pub.1130244215,10.1093/oso/9780190055295.003.0004,International Affairs,"This chapter explores how the use of military threats—that is, deterrence—has operated between and among nations. It begins with a brief history of conventional deterrence aimed at preventing wars by threatening either that an initial attack will fail to gain its objective (deterrence by denial) or that an attacker will be sufficiently punished so as to regret the initial action and thus prevent such an attack in the first place (deterrence by punishment). This leads to the self-serving phenomenon of bureaucratic “threat inflation” and then to the most consequential uses and abuses of threats: nuclear deterrence. The chapter then discusses how nuclear deterrence is supposed to work and whether it has in fact worked. It also provides a critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of nuclear deterrence.",Threats,2020,,,121-216,"Barash, David P.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130244215,0,
pub.1130244212,10.1093/oso/9780190055295.003.0001,A Nonthreatening Start,"This chapter provides an overview of threats. Threats are ubiquitous; they are so encompassing that they often go unnoticed. Although people are especially aware of explicit threats, other threats are often hidden, leaving most of the interpersonal ones implicit and therefore psychologically fraught. Warnings, in contrast, can be impersonal and not necessarily conveyed by an individual. But sometimes, threats and warnings are indistinguishable. This book begins by going through the biology of threats as conveyed and received by animals, followed by a variety of socially mediated threats intended to prevent crime, along with such consequential threats as hellfire and brimstone, personal death, and gun violence and the rise of right-wing national populism, and culminates in a critical look at nuclear deterrence—the premier manifestation of threat at the international level. Of particular note is how responses to threats often become counterproductive: hardly at all in the case of animals, occasionally in the personal and social realm, and then overwhelmingly when it comes to nuclear deterrence.",Threats,2020,,,1-6,"Barash, David P.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130244212,0,
pub.1133213500,10.4337/cilj.2020.02.05,"Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND): a good faith, effective measure pursuant to Article VI NPT or empty gesturing?","It has been 50 years since the adoption of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which established the obligation upon all States Parties to work towards nuclear disarmament under Article VI. Yet, despite extensive reductions in nuclear weapons stockpiles since the Cold War peaks, nuclear arms control and disarmament efforts are currently in disarray. After the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was terminated in 2019, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty remains as the only bilateral limitation on United States (US) and Russian nuclear forces in operation and is due to expire in February 2021. The US has justified its limited nuclear disarmament progress on the premise that the current international security environment is not conducive to further nuclear disarmament. Instead, the US has recently promoted a new initiative called Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND). The initiative aims to provide a platform for all States to engage in constructive dialogue to identify ways to improve the international security environment, which make nuclear deterrence necessary while addressing the hurdles that currently impede progress towards nuclear disarmament. Significantly, the US regards CEND as an ‘effective measure’ and an illustration of its commitment towards disarmament under Article VI. This article seeks to address the US claim that CEND represents a good faith, effective measure towards nuclear disarmament pursuant to Article VI. This will revisit existing doctrinal interpretative debates concerning the obligation under Article VI, particularly the requirements that negotiations and measures be adopted in good faith, and what constitutes an effective measure towards nuclear disarmament. The discussion will then determine whether the CEND initiative itself can be considered a good faith, effective measure towards nuclear disarmament, by considering its purpose, origins and implementation, and actions of the US.",Cambridge International Law Journal,2020,9,2,201-224,"Evans, Christopher P",University of Reading,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133213500,0,
pub.1132967613,10.1515/sirius-2020-4002,Die (unvollkommene) Rückkehr der Abschreckung,"Abstract Russia’s annexation of Crimea and a new era of great power competition have led to a renaissance of deterrence as an important part of Western security and defence policy. However, this renaissance is marked by serious flaws, such as a high degree of alarmism injected largely by a new obsession with hybrid threats, and the contradiction of doubting the reliability of traditional military deterrence while at the same time seeking to extend the deterrence paradigm into the “grey area” of non-kinetic threats. Overall, the current deterrence debate appears to be a substitute for what should be a much broader debate on the future role of the US and the relationship between the West and its strategic competitors.",SIRIUS - Zeitschrift für Strategische Analysen,2020,4,4,387-398,"Rühle, Michael",North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Belgium,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132967613,0,"[de Wijk, Rob]|[ur.011262067654.49]|SIRIUS - Zeitschrift für Strategische Analysen|2018|2|1|3-20|10.1515/sirius-2018-0002|pub.1101631094|4;[Bergeron, James Henry]|[]|SIRIUS - Zeitschrift für Strategische Analysen|2018|2|1|21-31|10.1515/sirius-2018-0003|pub.1101636217|3;[Thomson, James A.]|[]|SIRIUS - Zeitschrift für Strategische Analysen|2018|2|1|1-8|10.1515/sirius-2018-0024|pub.1103895207|1;[Roberts, Brad]|[]|SIRIUS - Zeitschrift für Strategische Analysen|2018|2|2|170-177|10.1515/sirius-2018-2007|pub.1104587912|3;[Kroenig, Matthew]|[ur.016445765773.87]|SIRIUS - Zeitschrift für Strategische Analysen|2018|2|4|323-338|10.1515/sirius-2018-4002|pub.1110652204|4;[Halas, Matus]|[ur.015555406530.25]|European Security|2019|28|4|1-18|10.1080/09662839.2019.1637855|pub.1117966627|2;[Kroenig, Matthew]|[ur.07615147657.32]|Comparative Strategy|2020|39|4|401-403|10.1080/01495933.2020.1772635|pub.1128879120|1;[Willasey-Wilsey, Tim]|[ur.015732163051.18]|International Affairs|2020|96|5|1432-1433|10.1093/ia/iiaa149|pub.1130675121|1"

pub.1133134528,10.48015/2076-7404-2020-12-3-45-84,Lessons of World War II and Strategic Planning of the Big Three (1945–1949),"The paper examines how military and political leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States and Great Britain assessed in the first post-war years and in the face of emerging bipolar world order the lessons of World War II, how the latter influenced their strategic planning and forecasts with the emergence of nuclear weapons. The author outlines the key features of this period (1945–1949), including still fresh memories of the unprecedented destruction and losses of the past war, the US ‘nuclear monopoly’, and the absence of a system for nuclear deterrence. The paper provides a systematic comparison of lessons from the past war, learnt by the Soviet, the US and British establishment, identifies similarities and differences between them. The author concludes that WWII was perceived by the political and military leaders of that time as a model of the eventual ‘great war’ in the future, which almost certainly would be ‘total’ and ‘global’ in scope and would demand both thorough preparations during the peacetime and the militarization of civil life. Indeed, the experience of WWII had greatly influenced the strategic and operational planning in the USSR, the USA and Great Britain in 1945–1949. Moscow prepared to face the potential aggression on its Western borders or in the Far East in order to avoid the mistakes of 1941. In Washington the decisionmakers acknowledged the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons and didn’t exclude the possibility that the Soviet Army could quickly establish control over the Western Europe and that the US military would have to retake it in a ‘new Operation Overlord’. The pessimistic outlook of the ‘defense of the Rhine’ was also shared in London, and the British military planned to evacuate the troops to the British Isles (‘shadow of Dunkirk’) and to focus on strategic bombing of the USSR and its allies. Even the appearance of nuclear weapons, that would dramatically alter the strategic context in the following years, played a relatively minor role in 1945–1949. The author concludes that the shadow of World War II and its lessons had a long-lasting effect on the post-war international relations.",,2020,12,3,45-84,"Magadeev, I.

pub.1132356507,10.1093/ips/olaa024,Sound Matters: How Sonic Formations Shape the Nuclear Deterrence and Non-Proliferation Regimes,"Abstract Sound matters for international political sociology. Drawing upon literature from cultural geography and sound studies, we argue that sound contributes to political dynamics that are constitutive of world politics. To capture these dynamics, we offer a set of conceptual frameworks to analyze sound. First, we differentiate the concept of sound from noise and show the importance of doing so. Second, we introduce “sonic formations” as a means of capturing how sound contributes to world politics. Third, we make the case for analyzing sound's historicity, adaptability, relationality, and performativity (SHARP) in any given context.

He is, after all, interested in escaping the condition of war, rather than exploiting its political utility. And yet, exactly because of this, Leviathan addresses the principal difficulty with strategic deliberation – which is the epistemic deficit that attends human interaction, encouraging anticipatory violence. As the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz observed, minimizing the costs of war involves identifying opportunities for exercising mutual restraint over its conduct. And achieving this requires that the aforementioned epistemic deficit be ameliorated. For Hobbes, the sovereign state achieves this for its citizens; but he also considers other solutions in the context of relations between such states. The resulting insights are relevant to matters such as nuclear deterrence, and recent stability operations in the Middle East.",Defence Studies,2020,,,1-17,"Stone, John",King's College London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132361128,0,"[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2003|26|2|105-114|10.1162/01636600360569720|pub.1004649208|12;[Betts, Richard K.]|[]|International Security|2000|25|2|5-50|10.1162/016228800560444|pub.1012927641|58;[F.R.S., P.

The structure of this article is firstly to review preceding works both on theories related to extended deterrence and on area studies in the regions having lived with nuclear weapons. Secondly, it will reveal the current evaluation of the advanced nuclear weapons developed under the Kim Jong Un regime as well as the history of how the US extended deterrent for Japan has developed. Finally, I will theoretically analyze its influences on the US extended deterrent, especially focusing on Missile Defense (MD), for Japan, while contemplating the clearly changing security environment that has been observed nowadays. As a result of its verification, this article concludes that at present the credibility of the US extended deterrent to Japan has decreased when compared to the past seventy years, considering the ever longer spear of the DPRK, which is capable of reaching US metropolitan cities, such as Washington D.C. and NYC, and able to break through the shield of the US-Japan alliance.",,2020,2,,109-134,"Choi, Jung Hoon",Ritsumeikan University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132244044,0,

To this end, it elaborates on five primary institutions of global nuclear order: nuclear deterrence, nuclear arms control, nuclear nonproliferation, nuclear nonuse, and nuclear disarmament. The chapter then unpacks the conceptual logic of these five institutions in the context of peaceful and violent change in world politics and explores their mutual linkages and conflicts. It highlights both the limits of these institutions and their inherent incompatibilities, mindful of the extraordinary violence nuclear war can cause and the underlying fear that prevents nuclear powers from engaging in reckless behavior.",The Oxford Handbook of Peaceful Change in International Relations,2020,,,,"Smetana, Michal",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131548071,0,
pub.1133292613,10.37468/2307-1400-2020-3-5-15,Strategic culture: to the question of the evolution theory,"Status of the issue. The development of the theory of strategic culture began more than seven decades ago. To date, the theory has evolved from the theoretical justification of the behavioral styles of elites representing institutions and security services, to the development of models for the use of national strategic cultures as an important tool for political struggle at the global and regional levels. It should be noted that Russian political science is significantly lagging behind foreign science in the theoretical understanding of the problem and in the development of effective models for countering the Anglo-Saxon strategic culture, which has an openly aggressive Russophobic content. Results. In the course of political analysis of the evolution of the theory of strategic culture, four stages of its development and their features were identified. At the first stage-the 40-60s of the XX century, the main content was the study of national styles in strategic planning in the field of national security, caused by a military clash during the World War II. Stereotyping of the initial grounds and a certain ethnocentrism as the main features of the stage, were subjected to reasonable criticism and stimulated the further development of theoretical provisions of the problem. At the second stage – the 70-90s of the XX century researchers developed a methodology for structural and functional analysis, institutionalism and modeling of competitive relations between regional actors. This was caused by the advent of the era of nuclear deterrence. The third stage of the wave of research on strategic culture is formed at the turn of the XX and XXI centuries. Theoretical and methodological research is carried out during this period in the framework of a critical rethinking of previous approaches and the formation of a trend towards neorealism. On the basis of comparative analysis, distinctions and justifications of different types of strategic culture and corresponding strategic thinking, as well as the behavior of actors, were identified. At the present stage of theory evolution, the main attention of researchers is focused on the dynamics of changing strategic culture under the influence of threats and risks of globalization and specific events, identifying competing narratives within countries themselves, searching for effective models for changing existing national strategic cultures in the interests of the dominant regional strategic cultures – Anglo-Saxon, European, Asian (Chinese). The effectiveness of applying the results of Western research programs in political practice is proved by the process of reformatting, for example, the Ukrainian strategic culture with an anti-Russian trend. Application. Political science – in order to continue the debate on strategic culture, the further development of the theory in the light of modern conditions of the clash of strategic cultures on a global level, and also political practice of compromise to minimize the challenges, risks and threats in international relations at the regional and global levels. Conclusions. Further development of the theory of strategic culture is actualized by the sharp aggravation of the confrontation between national and regional strategic cultures in different geopolitical strategic regions of the planet. This confrontation is caused by two main factors: the presence and strengthening of a number of national strategic cultures and the desire to dominate individual national and regional strategic cultures. In the context of using national strategic cultures as an important tool of political struggle, the development of models for interaction of strategic cultures based on compromise can help to minimize risks in international relations. The level of modern theoretical understanding of the problem does not correspond to the complexity of tasks to ensure national, regional and global security.",,2020,2020,3,5-15,"Artamonov, V; Lukin, V; Musienko, T",St Petersburg University,Russia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133292613,0,"[Luckham, Robin]|[ur.013247017271.91]|Alternatives Global Local Political|1984|10|1|1-44|10.1177/030437548401000102|pub.1027879958|16;[Glenn, John]|[]|International Studies Review|2009|11|3|523-551|10.1111/j.1468-2486.2009.00872.x|pub.1029013039|24;[Gray, Colin S.]|[]|International Security|1981|6|2|21|10.2307/2538645|pub.1069980334|52;[Bloomfield, Alan]|[]|Australian Journal of Politics & History|2018|64|4|641-656|10.1111/ajph.12513|pub.1110011356|2;[Beeson, Mark; Bloomfield, Alan]|[ur.014121574216.27; ur.011226022325.65]|Contemporary Security Policy|2019|40|3|1-27|10.1080/13523260.2019.1594534|pub.1113060758|2"
pub.1131138977,10.29311/nmes.v10i1.3615,Deciphering Trump’s “Maximum Pressure” Policy: The Enduring Challenge of Containing Iran,"Since the advent of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the US has pursued a policy of containment towards Iran. In a major shift from Obama’s policy of appeasement, the Trump administration has spearheaded the “Maximum Pressure” campaign in an effort to contain Iran and coerce it into changing its behaviour. Although the fate of Trump’s policy remains a puzzle, it is evident that the US administration’s decisions, i.e. the withdrawal from the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), re-imposition of nuclear-related sanctions and re-securitisation of Iran as well as Tehran’s counter-strategies to defy US pressures have exacerbated the enmity between Washington and Tehran. By applying the Regional Security Complex theory and linking it with George Kennan’s “containment strategy”, this article attempts to deconstruct the modus operandi of Trump administration towards Iran and scrutinise the various policy tools the US has employed to implement the maximum pressure doctrine. This research concludes that through exerting vast economic sanctions, maximizing diplomatic pressures and maintaining military deterrence, the Trump administration aims to create the conditions of possibility for regime collapse in the event that Iran refuses to change its behaviour.

pub.1129456340,10.1093/isr/viz018,Grappling with Dr. Strangelove’s “Wargasm” Fantasy,"Abstract Dr. Strangelove continues to be viewed as one of the most acclaimed films of all-time. Likewise, international relations (IR) experts commonly list the film among the most essential IR-themed movies. The IR scholars who discuss Dr. Strangelove as a text or recommend it for courses generally claim that it can be used to explain nuclear deterrence, the security dilemma, mutually assured destruction, Cold War competition, and various other traditional serious concerns of the field. They also recognize that the satirical film is critical of nuclear strategy. This article considers Dr. Strangelove’s sexual subtext, involving important metaphors and symbols that IR scholars characteristically ignore. Yet, for decades, film critics and scholars from other disciplines have identified and emphasized the importance of the film's comedic “sexual framework” and concluding “wargasm.” Director Stanley Kubrick even acknowledged these key elements in private correspondence. The film suggests that the national security establishment's masculine view of the utility of nuclear weapons and deterrence are comparable to absurd male sexual fantasies. Feminist IR scholars frequently note that mainstream scholars largely ignore their critique of masculine views of the discipline and nuclear strategy. The article concludes that scholars in the field should both prioritize Dr. Strangelove’s sexual subtext and rely upon feminist contributions to help understand those elements.",International Studies Review,2020,22,3,464-481,"Payne, Rodger A",University of Louisville,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129456340,0,"[Lieberfeld, Daniel]|[ur.016326646061.17]|Political Science and Politics|2007|40|3|571-574|10.1017/s1049096507070837|pub.1001274165|14;[Bliddal, Henrik; Sylvest, Casper; Wilson, Peter]|[; ur.016034645067.31; ]||2013||||10.4324/9780203761472|pub.1003255627|9;[Stienstra, Deborah]|[ur.0752670712.13]|International Studies Perspectives|2000|1|3|233-244|10.1111/1528-3577.00024|pub.1006612429|9;[Kuzma, Lynn M.; Haney, Patrick J.]|[ur.012005106146.07; ur.010437450223.16]|International Studies Perspectives|2001|2|1|33-50|10.1111/1528-3577.00036|pub.1007833840|51;[Ringmar, Erik]|[ur.016457673323.97]|Cooperation and Conflict|2006|41|4|403-421|10.1177/0010836706069611|pub.1012322020|26;[Peach, Lucinda Joy]|[ur.012362505124.60]|Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction|2004|||436-450|10.1017/cbo9780511606861.024|pub.1018076155|3;[Grayson, Kyle; Davies, Matt; Philpott, Simon]|[ur.011365567655.13; ur.010751701150.94; ur.012344642150.09]|Australian Journal of Political Science|2009|29|3|155-163|10.1111/j.1467-9256.2009.01351.x|pub.1019966222|97;[Duncanson, Claire; Eschle, Catherine]|[; ]|New Political Science|2008|30|4|545-563|10.1080/07393140802518120|pub.1020863203|9;[Cohn, Carol; Ruddick, Sara]|[; ]|Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction|2004|||405-435|10.1017/cbo9780511606861.023|pub.1023230443|25;[Valeriano, Brandon]|[ur.013636643561.19]|Journal of Political Science Education|2013|9|1|52-72|10.1080/15512169.2013.747840|pub.1023419147|19;[Tickner, J.

pub.1129855892,10.1093/ia/iiaa096,Who stole disarmament? History and nostalgia in nuclear abolition discourse,"Abstract Influential members of the disarmament community have in recent years maintained that further progress towards the international community's nominally shared goal of a world without nuclear weapons depends on recapturing the spirit and practices of cooperation that prevailed in the late 1980s and 1990s. Proponents of abolition, in this view, should focus their efforts on revitalizing the tried and tested arms control formula that was implemented following the end of the Cold War. In this article, I argue that this call to make disarmament great again reflects unwarranted nostalgia for a past that never was, fostering overconfidence in established approaches to the elimination of nuclear weapons. Far from putting the world on course to nuclear abolition, the end of the Cold War saw the legitimation of nuclear weapons as a hedge against ‘future uncertainties’ and entrenchment of the power structures that sustain the retention of nuclear armouries. By overselling past progress towards the elimination of nuclear arms, the nostalgic narrative of a lost abolitionist consensus is used to rationalize the existing nuclear order and delegitimize the pursuit of new approaches to elimination such as the movement to stigmatize nuclear weapons and the practice of nuclear deterrence.",International Affairs,2020,96,5,1387-1403,"Egeland, Kjølv",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129855892,0,

Given that national security documents from both Taiwan and Japan indicate the need to deter state-sponsored cyberattacks, there is very little literature that empirically and theoretically investigates the utility of such an approach in this region. This paper looks into the various deterrence constructs and argues that none of them can be implemented without problems. The paper looks further into a deeper level of the conceptual issues upon which deterrence thinking is based and argues that an alternative strategy promoting regional cooperation is not only possible but also desirable in the current political climate. It is later concluded that looking for a one-size-fits-all solution is idealistic, and policymakers should develop security countermeasures that align with the threats posed by the actors they wish to confront.",Issues & Studies,2020,56,03,2040011,"YAU, HON-MIN",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130878801,0,"[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[]|International Security|2015|39|3|7-47|10.1162/isec_a_00189|pub.1009167389|39;[Lebow, Richard Ned]|[ur.011434531375.46]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2005|28|5|765-773|10.1080/01402390500393852|pub.1024473575|7;[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[]|Security Studies|2013|22|3|365-404|10.1080/09636412.2013.816122|pub.1025246311|117;[Farwell, James P.; Rohozinski, Rafal]|[ur.012517747437.29; ur.016353662501.84]|Survival|2011|53|1|23-40|10.1080/00396338.2011.555586|pub.1032711969|309;[Geers, Kenneth]|[ur.07624635135.06]|Computer Law & Security Review|2010|26|3|298-303|10.1016/j.clsr.2010.03.003|pub.1033025093|32;[Rid, Thomas; Buchanan, Ben]|[ur.010444241522.28; ur.013432143522.19]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2015|38|1-2|4-37|10.1080/01402390.2014.977382|pub.1035532991|130;[Stoddart, Kristan]|[ur.011224140637.88]|Political Science Quarterly|2016|131|4|803-842|10.1002/polq.12535|pub.1039337847|5;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1978|30|2|167-214|10.2307/2009958|pub.1051767591|949;[Lutz, Dieter S.]|[ur.010516536134.29]|Journal of Peace Research|1983|20|1|17-26|10.1177/002234338302000103|pub.1053786580|1;[Nye, Joseph S.]|[]|International Security|2017|41|3|44-71|10.1162/isec_a_00266|pub.1083410445|52;[Slayton, Rebecca]|[ur.013356225661.55]|International Security|2017|41|3|72-109|10.1162/isec_a_00267|pub.1083422396|36;[Berghel, Hal]|[ur.015223416561.55]|Computer|2017|50|3|84-89|10.1109/mc.2017.74|pub.1084203899|6;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]||2003||||10.1017/cbo9780511491573|pub.1098665879|78;[Walt, Stephen M.]|[]|Foreign Policy|1998||110|29|10.2307/1149275|pub.1102459411|138;[YAU, HON-MIN]|[ur.013425667034.23]|Issues & Studies|2018|54|02|1850004|10.1142/s1013251118500042|pub.1107246535|2;[]|[]||2017||||10.1017/9781316822524|pub.1109345493|95;[Yau, Hon-min]|[ur.013425667034.23]|Journal of Cyber Policy|2019|4|1|1-21|10.1080/23738871.2019.1604782|pub.1113406841|1;[Yau, Hon-min]|[ur.013425667034.23]|International Journal of Taiwan Studies|2019|2|2|264-291|10.1163/24688800-00202004|pub.1126939768|1"

pub.1129615998,10.23932/2542-0240-2020-13-2-3,“Hybrid Threats” to Russia’s Security: Identification and Counteraction,"In the scientific literature, it is customary to consider and analyze war exclusively as a violent (conventional) confrontation of subjects of international politics. However, this does not take into account that modern wars are increasingly unfolding in the “grey zone”, that is, outside the framework of international law, they are conducted both in physical and in other dimensions – informational, cybernetic, cultural, cognitive – and mainly by non-military means and with the involvement of irregular formations (rebels, terrorists, etc.). As a result, today’s interstate confrontation is becoming more complex and hybrid, presenting new mechanisms for non-nuclear deterrence. It is important to understand that the inability to recognize the enemy’s ongoing war in time, to determine the direction of the strike destroyed many states, starting with the Roman Empire and ending with the USSR. This determines the relevance and timeliness of this study, which is aimed at analyzing the content of the phenomenon of hybrid war, determining the main methods of its conduct used today and proposing counteraction measures. It should be recognized that in the modern scientific literature there is no single approach to understanding what a hybrid war is, which is quite understandable precisely because of its essence – the variability and complexity of ways of it conducting, as well as flexibility and adaptability to specific circumstances. There are quite a lot of disparate studies on individual components of hybrid war, such as “soft power”, information, economic and cyberwar, “color revolutions”, etc. The subject of this research is the phenomenon of hybrid warfare, its content and specific ways of conducting hybrid warfare. The purpose of this work is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the subject of research, as well as to structure the manifestation that form the phenomenon of hybrid war in its complex, determine their correlation and mutual influence of various methods of conducting hybrid war, as well as to develop specific proposals for countering threats to Russia’s national security. The importance of developing comprehensive strategic approaches aimed primarily at identifying vulnerabilities, as well as including spiritual security as the basis of the entire security system and countering hybrid threats is emphasized. Taking into account the specified subject and purpose, the introduction reveals the relevance of the study of the phenomenon of hybrid war and the danger that this type of interstate confrontation poses for Russia. Then we analyze the concept of hybrid war and its content, as well as the four main ways of conducting it. The results of the analysis are followed by conclusions and proposals on countering threats to Russia’s national security.",Outlines of global transformations politics economics law,2020,13,2,44-71,"Kodaneva, S.

pub.1129335975,10.1177/0022343319898714,Simulation analysis on the effectiveness of missile defense,"Literatures on the influences of missile defense (MD) on the existing nuclear deterrence are divided into negative and positive perspectives. However, both sides seem to make contradictory arguments. Skeptics argue that it is not feasible that MD influences deterrence stability but that it causes security dilemma and arms race, while proponents suggest that MD does not have to be perfect to reinforce deterrence stability but that it does not cause security dilemma and arms race. To fix this logical inconsistency, we identify an additional variable which is crucial in understanding the security dilemma mechanism in addition to Jervis’s (1978) two variables. By adding another variable, a minimum MD effectiveness level required for deterrence success suggested by Quackenbush (2006), to Jervis’s framework, we develop three hypotheses, two of which are novel on MD and its potential influences on deterrence stability and arms race. We then introduce a probabilistic model of the MD effectiveness by modifying Wilkening’s (2000) and conduct simulation analysis to see if MD is more likely to incur security dilemma and arms race. Our simulation results show that MD influence is likely to be different depending on a potential challenger’s national capability. Against a great power challenger, MD is least likely to meet the minimum MD effectiveness level required for deterrence success, so that the challenger is more likely to respond flexibly to the defender’s buildup of MD. Against a newly nuclear-armed state, however, a defender’s MD is more likely to satisfy the minimum MD effectiveness level, so that the defender is highly likely to respond flexibly to the potential challenger’s reinforcement effort of its nuclear force. In either case, our simulation results indicate that arms races concerning MD among them are not likely to occur.",Journal of Peace Research,2020,,,002234331989871,"Kim, Jaehak; Kim, Woosang",Yonsei University,South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129335975,0,"[Glaser, Charles L.; Fetter, Steve]|[ur.015171401702.20; ur.010107403101.87]|International Security|2016|41|1|49-98|10.1162/isec_a_00248|pub.1001430062|18;[LEBOVIC, JAMES H.]|[]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2002|46|4|455-483|10.1177/0022002702046004001|pub.1002027672|9;[Ding, Arthur S.]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|1999|6|4|93-101|10.1080/10736709908436782|pub.1005880833|3;[Zhang, Baohui]|[ur.014464411053.98]|Asian Survey|2011|51|2|311-332|10.1525/as.2011.51.2.311|pub.1009776273|2;[Powell, Robert]|[]|International Security|2003|27|4|86-118|10.1162/016228803321951108|pub.1015346075|29;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|International Security|2006|30|4|7-44|10.1162/isec.2006.30.4.7|pub.1025314466|62;[Quackenbush, Stephen L.]|[ur.016002166721.08]|Political Research Quarterly|2006|59|4|533-541|10.1177/106591290605900403|pub.1051197124|8;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1978|30|2|167-214|10.2307/2009958|pub.1051767591|949;[Wilkening, Dean A.]|[ur.0670715150.99]|Science & Global Security|2000|8|2|183-215|10.1080/08929880008426475|pub.1051934569|25;[Quackenbush, Stephen L; Drury, A Cooper]|[ur.016002166721.08; ur.015566511375.67]|Journal of Peace Research|2011|48|4|469-480|10.1177/0022343311402108|pub.1053784677|4;[Ordway, Girard L.; Rosenstock, Henry M.]|[ur.010761371230.36; ]|Operations Research|1963|11|1|40-56|10.1287/opre.11.1.40|pub.1064726280|1;[Layno, Salvador B.]|[ur.011351771723.22]|Operations Research|1971|19|6|1502-1517|10.1287/opre.19.6.1502|pub.1064727650|3;[Brams, Steven J.; Kilgour, D.

The subject of the study is to determine the place and role of France in the European nuclear defence debate of the XXI century.Based on the above, the purpose of this article is: first, to define the role of France in the strategic dialogue on nuclear deterrence within Europe under changes in the European security environment; second, to highlight the unique features of French strategic concept of nuclear deterrence, formed while increasing threats and changing the balance of power in Europe and in the world.The methodological basis of the research is the principles of comprehensiveness, completeness and objectivity. The usage of synthesis and analysis methods, together with the application of the system method, enable us to determine the meaning of the concept of France’s nuclear status in the situation of deep global transformations of European defence policy of the XXI century and response to modern security challenges. The practical significance of the study is to identify critical aspects of France’s security strategy within Europe, which allows for a more constructive dialogue on security in Europe.According to the results of the study, the authors came to the following conclusions: 1. In recent years, France’s role in the European environment has changed significantly, and its geopolitical ambitions have increased as well. Which happened due to a change of the geopolitical context of the European security architecture, especially with the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union since France became the EU’s only nuclear power.2. Rising security threats to Europe, in particular from China and Russia, as well as uncertainty about US security guarantees, have necessitated a reassessment of the security situation in Europe and a renewed discourse on strategic nuclear and consolidated European defence forces and deepened strategic cooperation.3. Today, France, led by E. Macron, is ready to make more significant commitments in Europe’s security environment by initiating a strategic dialogue, deepening security cooperation, initiating joint exercises and calling for an increase in the defence budget, as well as finalizing the legal framework on the question of the vital interests of Europe. The central thesis of the updated concept of France’s security strategy 2020 was the Europeanization of its national interests, their deep integration into vital European interests and the European dimension of its security.",Філософія та політологія в контексті сучасної культури,2020,12,1,203-210,"Menshakova, Daria",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129823147,0,
pub.1129060815,10.1080/09546553.2020.1742113,Eradicating Terrorism in Asymmetric Conflict: The Role and Essence of Military Deterrence,"This study quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes the impact and effectiveness of Turkey’s deterrence-oriented incapacitation effort throughout Turkey’s PKK conflict (1984–2018). By employing vector autoregressive (VAR) analysis, this study quantitatively finds that incapacitation did not reduce PKK violence over the long term and yielded a short-term counterproductive effect. Descriptive analysis asserts that while incapacitation had important mid-term deterring effects, it did not have any sustainable mitigation on the PKK insurrection. This is because, as this study argues, these deterrent impacts were not strategically converted into political gains/results. Considering the latest phase of the conflict, in which Turkey’s intra-state strife has become increasingly regionalized and lately internationalized in military and political terms with the emergence of the Syrian civil war, particularly the rise of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), this study claims that the sole application of an incapacitation-oriented eliminationist approach has become less relevant and less effective. The study suggests that deterrence should be considered within the strategic tit-for-tat game to force/compel the non-state actor to make the conflict more manageable by transforming it in a strategic way, in which strategy of deterrence is to be attached to visionary, long-term, and viable grand strategic political end-states and to be considered within the grand bargaining game.",Terrorism and Political Violence,2020,,,1-45,"Unal, Mustafa Cosar; Cafnik Uludağ, Petra",Bilkent University,Turkey,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129060815,0,

Nuclear Umbrella, 1964–8","During the Cold War, a non-nuclear U.S. ally, Japan, relied on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence for its security. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, Japan’s alignment with the United States was a focal point of political confrontation between the conservative and progressive camps while the public opinion was divided over the issue. Moreover, the public sentiment against nuclear weapons was so strong that the conservative camp had to compete with the progressive camp to better represent the public sentiment. As a result, the conservative government and the governing party were in the politically awkward position of having to carefully avoid making statements and taking actions that might have stimulated the public’ anti-nuclear sentiment and, further, might have been interpreted as distrust of the U.S.–Japan alignment and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. This article illustrates the combined effects of public opinion and party politics on Japan’s reliance on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence, specifically the government’s public explanation of it, the establishment of it as a declared government policy and U.S.–Japan relationships regarding it in the late 1960s. To this end, it examines the government-level policy-deliberation and diplomacy as well as policy discussions on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence in the national legislature.",The International History Review,2020,42,4,1-20,"Kurosaki, Akira",Fukushima University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120308063,0,

Focusing on East Asia, the most significant regional powers are the US and China, which although they are becoming competitors, also depend on each other over a large number of economic and regional security issues (e.g. North Korea). But on the whole, China and the US are struggling for regional hegemony and influence. They are pursuing large-scale armament efforts and investing heavily in emerging military technologies, thereby feeding the risk of violent confrontations and threatening stability and peace. In this connection, US Missile Defence represents one of China's major concerns. Focusing on US Missile Defence efforts in the Western Pacific region, this article presents an overview of the currently-deployed systems and plans for further development. It analyses the technological capabilities of associated sensor and interceptor elements and estimates their individual abilities to contribute to an integrated US Missile Defence architecture in this region. Finally, this state of short- to mid-term US Missile Defence capacity in the region is situated in relation to its impact on nuclear deterrence and strategic stability, taking account of both Chinese security concerns and US security interests. Assuming that both the US and China have a common interest in regional and strategic stability, the article concludes by discussing arms control measures. It suggests concrete options for confidence building and proposes achievable steps, which would promote a Sino-American discourse on joint security issues and strengthen crisis stability as well as regional security.",Asian Affairs,2020,51,3,1-16,"Alwardt, Christian",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130543220,0,

Moreover, the effort to achieve strategic stability in this day and age has become increasingly complicated in light of the changing relationship among the great powers. Today’s world has become one of “security trilemmas.” Actions one state takes to defend against another can, in-turn, make a third state feel insecure. There is great need for both nuclear diversity (theater and low-yield weapons) and increased conventional capabilities in the U.S. deterrent force to provide strategic stability in the decades ahead.

The main hypothesis of the paper is based on the assumption, that the deterrence potential of the Israeli nuclear arsenal is strictly determined by deliberate ambiguity (so-called amimut). The author also assumes that nuclear deterrence plays a significant role in the general Israeli deterrence strategy. However, due to the changing nature of threats, it is not its core element. The author used the following theoretical research methods: critical analysis and comparative analysis of sources, scientific studies, strategic documents as well as selected speeches of the Israeli authorities.

From the signing of 123 US-India Nuclear Deal to the facilitation in becoming a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the US has clearly designated India as an instrumental element in the American grand strategy of devising a ‘new world order’. As a result, India has grabbed the opportunity of alleviating its status as a credible regional and global power. In this regard, the US tilt towards India is significantly paving grounds for a strategic imbalance in the South Asian region, thus creating challenges for Pakistan. Therefore, this paper argues that the growing bonhomie between the US and India is a destabilizing factor in the region which reinforces Pakistan’s fast falling into the Chinese orbit; thereby cementing the old friendship into a new strategic partnership. This dynamic certainly gives China and Pakistan an incentive to work together so as to keep the value of Pakistan’s nuclear deterrence alive. In an effort to expand the horizon on the subject, the paper is dedicated to critically examine the existing cooperation between India and the US while equally foreseeing the possible implications for the region in the face of such destabilizing cooperation. More importantly, based on qualitative data, this paper explores how Indo-US strategic partnership is directly impacting Pakistan and its strategic partnership with China; thereby explaining how the growing relationship between the US and India has undermined the traditional balance-of-power in the South Asian region?",,2020,,,,"Jahangir, Asifa; Khan, Furqan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124827728,0,

Owing to the limited information emerging from China, even the number of SSBNs in service with the PLA Navy at present remains an estimate.

Based on the analysis of China’s professed nuclear policy, possible SSBN deployment patterns, and developing shipyard infrastructure, this paper assesses the capacity as well as perceived requirement of Chinese SSBNs. Accordingly, the author offers forecasts for SSBN force levels by 2030 and by 2040.

Through French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan’s Hysteric Discourse, the article advances the study of the neurotic subject to include the security policy expert. By introducing and applying a ‘hysteric reading strategy’ to the processes through which US cyber defence experts identify as policy experts, the article suggests that the constantly changing demands for policy change produced by these experts suggest a desire not simply for new policies that promise cyber defence but for desire itself. From this, the article argues that these experts occupy a social position in which desire is perpetually sliding from one object to the next, always placing cyber defence out of reach, and hence, reproducing ‘cyber’ as an insecurity in the present. The article sees this dynamic play out both in the evolving cache of policy recommendations on cyber deterrence produced by the cyber policy experts, and in the revolving doors between government and this expert community.",Critical Studies on Security,2020,8,1,1-13,"Jacobsen, Jeppe Teglskov",Royal Danish Defence College,Denmark,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125315374,1,"[Huysmans, Jef]|[ur.011654704577.66]||2006||||10.4324/9780203008690|pub.1001615715|609;[Berling, Trine Villumsen; Bueger, Christian]|[ur.014461037313.76; ur.014436261750.41]||2015||||10.4324/9781315744797|pub.1004577902|21;[Büger, Christian; Villumsen, Trine]|[ur.011125527217.40; ur.0611631624.09]|Journal of International Relations and Development|2007|10|4|417-448|10.1057/palgrave.jird.1800136|pub.1007609405|41;[Isin, Engin F.]|[ur.015036054427.40]|Citizenship Studies|2004|8|3|217-235|10.1080/1362102042000256970|pub.1008675991|186;[Bigo, Didier]|[]|Alternatives Global Local Political|2002|27|1_suppl|63-92|10.1177/03043754020270s105|pub.1016056218|980;[Epstein, Charlotte]|[]|European Journal of International Relations|2011|17|2|327-350|10.1177/1354066109350055|pub.1022693534|117;[Aradau, Claudia; Van Munster, Rens]|[ur.012560715401.45; ur.013535504511.46]||2011||||10.4324/9780203815793|pub.1022780007|126;[Walklate, Sandra; Mythen, Gabriel]|[ur.014565673711.32; ur.01337033551.44]|British Journal of Sociology|2010|61|1|45-62|10.1111/j.1468-4446.2009.01301.x|pub.1025476710|27;[Mandelbaum, Moran M.]|[ur.013404532703.23]|Critical Studies on Security|2016|4|2|1-15|10.1080/21624887.2016.1163921|pub.1028232313|12;[De Goede, Marieke]|[ur.013323566037.47]|Security Dialogue|2008|39|2-3|155-176|10.1177/0967010608088773|pub.1035423718|133;[Fournier, Philippe]|[]|Critical Studies on Security|2014|2|3|309-322|10.1080/21624887.2014.909232|pub.1036375124|14;[Aradau, Claudia; Lobo-Guerrero, Luis; Van Munster, Rens]|[ur.012560715401.45; ; ur.013535504511.46]|Security Dialogue|2008|39|2-3|147-154|10.1177/0967010608089159|pub.1037955707|88;[Cavelty, Myriam Dunn]|[ur.011312752443.31]|International Studies Review|2013|15|1|105-122|10.1111/misr.12023|pub.1041583465|66;[Amoore, Louise; de Goede, Marieke]|[ur.012526205437.61; ur.013323566037.47]||2008||||10.4324/9780203927700|pub.1045663259|173;[Bell, Colleen]|[]|Security Dialogue|2006|37|2|147-165|10.1177/0967010606066168|pub.1047286901|30;[Bigo, Didier; Tsoukala, Anastassia]|[ur.013750310777.19; ur.012660505445.90]||2008|20083125|||10.4324/9780203926765|pub.1047372095|241;[Eberle, Jakub]|[ur.011126314033.77]|Journal of International Relations and Development|2019|22|1|243-268|10.1057/s41268-017-0104-2|pub.1085426215|25;[Heath-Kelly, Charlotte]|[ur.01016222243.28]|Critical Studies on Security|2018|6|1|85-99|10.1080/21624887.2017.1407595|pub.1092923990|6;[Rich, Andrew]|[]||2004||||10.1017/cbo9780511509889|pub.1098677415|216;[Solomon, Ty]|[]||2015||||10.3998/mpub.5031921|pub.1099313111|32;[Danil, L.

There are multiple studies of nuclear doctrine in relation to each country, yet this article tries to connect them in the sense of consiring the possible influence of Moscow’s nuclear doctrine on Beijing. In doing this, the author examines the nature of the growing ‘strategic partnership’ between Russia and China to include tracing its origins, limits, and ambiguity and the speculative question of an emerging ‘de facto alliance’. It outlines the growth in military-to-military contacts, developing joint military exercises both bilateral and multilateral, as well as Moscow’s decision to involve China in its annual strategic level military exercises, contrasting Vostok 2010 and Vostok 2018. Indeed, there is a policy perception in Western government circles, particularly in the United States, that should war erupt with Russia that the latter will find itself alone; this is certainly open to question and potentially a dangerous oversight in Washington policy circles, as well as among its allies. The article also raises important questions concerning Moscow’s continued adherence to the undeclared nuclear policy of ‘escalate-to-de-escalate’ and its further strengthening of the conventional level of ‘pre-nuclear’ deterrence. In essence, this article raises questions of interest in the policy and scholarly communities, rather than proving concrete conclusions.",The Journal of Slavic Military Studies,2020,33,1,44-88,"McDermott, Roger N.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125977862,0,
pub.1126505984,10.1080/25751654.2020.1747907,From Deterrence to Cooperative Security on the Korean Peninsula,"The 2018 US-DPRK Singapore Summit introduced a new model to guide resolution of long-standing disputes on the Korean Peninsula: a “lasting and stable peace regime” could be created simultaneously with the “complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”. This model established a continuum of objectives and milestone that extends as far as creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. An overlooked but critical obstacle to progress toward those objectives is the need to diminish the role of deterrence in inter-Korean affairs. Cooperative security, both as process and destination, is a useful concept for guiding the shift away from deterrence. Developing cooperative security necessitates deeper efforts than assumed in a peace regime to reduce aggregated offensive military capability. Beyond facilitation by the United States and China, the two Koreas have considerable agency to implement steps that alter their conventional military force balance and postures. Cooperative security can also help reduce the salience of nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula by creating a conflict escalation firebreak, which can mitigate the risk that small-scale DPRK “tactical provocations” lead to major war, or even use of nuclear weapons. Inter-Korean initiatives are a critical complement to multiparty work on denuclearization and a peace regime, yet face several constraints from big power interests. Furthermore, pursuit of cooperative security is in basic tension with unification as the dominant framework for inter-Korean relations, such that continued emphasis on unification, especially in South Korean politics, is a likely impediment to progress.",Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament,2020,3,1,144-156,"Dalton, Toby",Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126505984,0,"[Bell, Mark S.]|[]|International Security|2015|40|1|87-119|10.1162/isec_a_00204|pub.1029429155|23;[Fearon, James D.]|[ur.0773121250.02]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1997|41|1|68-90|10.1177/0022002797041001004|pub.1031866226|428;[LI, Nan]|[]|East Asian Policy|2017|09|04|16-26|10.1142/s1793930517000320|pub.1100729030|2"

However, if the broader international constitutional architecture, which includes the UN Charter as well as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is considered, the doctrine of nuclear deterrence can be contained and, moreover, pathways to nuclear disarmament can be laid. This chapter places the non-proliferation regime and the doctrine of nuclear deterrence within the wider constitutional order derived from the UN Charter. In this order ‘security’ and ‘law’ are separate but related, and nuclear deterrence sits uneasily between the two. ‘Security’ is defined by the five Permanent Members/recognised nuclear-weapon States. This has an influence on non-proliferation law especially as regards non-State actors, executive law making, and non-forcible measures against Iran and North Korea. Beyond these measures the five States have used their position in the constitutional order to protect the existing nuclear hierarchy and with it the doctrine of nuclear deterrence. Although the UN General Assembly and disarmament bodies have provided balance by consensual law making in the area of non-proliferation law, the fulfilment of Article VI of the NPT will require a recognition and management of nuclear deterrence.",Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume V,2020,,,237-267,"White, Nigel D.",University of Nottingham,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123792143,0,"[Louka, Elli]|[ur.011002146153.86]||2011||||10.4337/9780857931092|pub.1005659056|4;[Sossai, Mirko]|[]|Research Handbook on International Conflict and Security Law|2013|||41-66|10.4337/9781849808576.00007|pub.1023423864|2;[Rietiker, Daniel]|[ur.015552371727.82]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume I|2014|||47-84|10.1007/978-94-6265-020-6_3|pub.1031024748|4;[]|[]|Journal of American History|2016|102|4|1255.1-1255|10.1093/jahist/jav716|pub.1059743122|2;[Anastassov, A.]|[]|Journal of Conflict and Security Law|2010|15|1|65-87|10.1093/jcsl/krp023|pub.1059754229|2;[Sellers, Mortimer]|[]|The American Journal of International Law|2005|99|4|949-953|10.2307/3396704|pub.1070296748|19;[White, Nigel D.]|[]|Non-Proliferation Law as a Special Regime|2012|||87-118|10.1017/cbo9780511842122.005|pub.1089469476|2;[Kaplan, Edward]|[]||2015||||10.7591/9780801455506|pub.1098654784|2;[Simpson, Gerry]|[]||2004||||10.1017/cbo9780511494185|pub.1098665797|185;[Chesterman, Simon; Johnstone, Ian; Malone, David M.]|[; ; ]||2016||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199399482.001.0001|pub.1098714225|11;[Joyner, Daniel H.]|[]||2009||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199204908.001.0001|pub.1098742184|15;[Bennett, Gill]|[]|The RUSI Journal|2018|163|1|1-2|10.1080/03071847.2018.1447300|pub.1101547793|1;[Fetter, Steve; Wolfsthal, Jon]|[ur.010107403101.87; ]|Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament|2018|1|1|102-114|10.1080/25751654.2018.1454257|pub.1101836034|6;[Willrich, Mason]|[]|The Yale Law Journal|1968|77|8|1447|10.2307/794833|pub.1102876208|4;[Rietiker, Daniel]|[ur.015552371727.82]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume IV|2019|||325-353|10.1007/978-94-6265-267-5_15|pub.1110786144|2;[Fleck, Dieter]|[ur.014034325464.02]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume IV|2019|||395-415|10.1007/978-94-6265-267-5_18|pub.1110786147|4"

Using Australia as the primary example, this chapter argues that the hostility of nuclear umbrella States towards the TPNW undermines their contention that they remain committed to nuclear disarmament under Article VI. It demonstrates that Australia’s main criticism of the TPNW—that banning nuclear weapons is not an effective measure for disarmament—is a weak legal justification designed to mask the fact that it is prioritising nuclear deterrence over nuclear elimination.",Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume V,2020,,,269-290,"Cormier, Monique",University of New England,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123785168,0,"[Tanter, Richard]|[ur.012462642417.77]|Pacific Focus|2011|26|1|113-136|10.1111/j.1976-5118.2011.01058.x|pub.1010755223|3;[PIETROBON, ALESSANDRA]|[]|Leiden Journal of International Law|2014|27|1|169-188|10.1017/s0922156513000587|pub.1012286275|2;[Joyner, Daniel H.]|[]|Nuclear Weapons under International Law|2014|||397-417|10.1017/cbo9781107337435.025|pub.1014646499|2;[Clark, Roger S.]|[]|Criminal Law Forum|1996|7|2|265-298|10.1007/bf02197167|pub.1020026279|3;[Rietiker, Daniel]|[ur.015552371727.82]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume I|2014|||47-84|10.1007/978-94-6265-020-6_3|pub.1031024748|4;[Pregenzer, Arian L.]|[ur.013364225562.02]|The Nonproliferation Review|2008|15|3|529-538|10.1080/10736700802407176|pub.1032711718|2;[Leah, Christine M.]|[]|Asian Security|2012|8|2|93-114|10.1080/14799855.2012.686249|pub.1044772361|4;[Ford, Christopher A.]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|2007|14|3|401-428|10.1080/10736700701611720|pub.1048813282|15;[]|[]|Journal of Conflict and Security Law|2017|22|1|1-3|10.1093/jcsl/krx003|pub.1085247480|1;[UNODA]|[]|Civil Society and Disarmament|2016|||16-17|10.18356/cba61ada-en|pub.1090049122|5;[Joyner, Daniel H.]|[]||2011||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199227358.001.0001|pub.1098764192|34;[]|[]||2004||||10.5040/9781472563033|pub.1099539945|21;[Thakur, Ramesh]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2017|40|4|71-95|10.1080/0163660x.2017.1406709|pub.1099664564|17;[Butler, Richard]|[]|AQ Australian Quarterly|1987|59|1|91|10.2307/20635416|pub.1102167881|1;[Acheson, Ray]|[]|Global Change Peace & Security|2018|30|2|1-8|10.1080/14781158.2018.1465907|pub.1103779942|28;[Egeland, Kjølv; Hugo, Torbjørn Graff; Løvold, Magnus; Nystuen, Gro]|[ur.016370252261.78; ur.010003671767.37; ur.013611356043.33; ur.011360364657.59]|Medicine Conflict & Survival|2018|34|2|1-21|10.1080/13623699.2018.1483878|pub.1104888679|5;[Camilleri, Joseph; Hamel-Green, Michael]|[ur.016153446135.37; ur.010470253414.56]|Global Change Peace & Security|2018|30|2|87-93|10.1080/14781158.2018.1474866|pub.1104910422|1;[Hamel-Green, Michael]|[ur.010470253414.56]|Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament|2018|1|2|436-463|10.1080/25751654.2018.1516493|pub.1107089708|3;[McPhedran, Marilou; Hebb, David]|[; ]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume IV|2019|||355-375|10.1007/978-94-6265-267-5_16|pub.1110786145|1;[Hayashi, Nobuo]|[]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume IV|2019|||377-394|10.1007/978-94-6265-267-5_17|pub.1110786146|2;[Fleck, Dieter]|[ur.014034325464.02]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume IV|2019|||395-415|10.1007/978-94-6265-267-5_18|pub.1110786147|4;[Rydell, Randy]|[]|The Challenge of Abolishing Nuclear Weapons|2017|||227-242|10.4324/9781315131160-16|pub.1111183654|1"

In this context nuclear weapons look set to remain a permanent feature of the international strategic landscape, making it critical that developments undermining nuclear deterrence and strategic stability are interrogated. This chapter does this in four stages. First, it outlines the evolution of nuclear deterrence theory during the Cold War, and how changes after the Cold War led to a reconceptualization of deterrence theory and strategy by the United States. Second, it shows that a raft of emerging technologies, including ballistic missiles defenses, cyber technologies, Artificial Intelligence and social media, are undermining the foundations of nuclear deterrence and strategic stability. Third, it explains why contemporary international politics is not conducive to the nuclear disarmament agenda, as great power competition escalates between the U.S. and China, and U.S. and Russia. It concludes by asserting that the arms control regime must be reconfigured to address the most destabilising features of the contemporary security environment.",Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,2020,,,57-75,"Steff, Reuben",University of Waikato,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124123545,0,"[Knopf, Jeffrey W.]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2008|29|2|229-265|10.1080/13523260802284076|pub.1002759942|6;[Bracken, Paul]|[]|Orbis|2016|60|2|188-203|10.1016/j.orbis.2016.02.002|pub.1004793325|6;[Futter, Andrew]|[ur.015532034615.41]|European Security|2016|25|2|163-180|10.1080/09662839.2015.1112276|pub.1014536145|2;[Snyder, Glenn Herald]|[]||1961||||10.1515/9781400877164|pub.1018970969|179;[Cimbala, Stephen J.; McDermott, Roger N.]|[ur.012111147147.09; ur.015304040155.27]|Comparative Strategy|2015|34|1|95-111|10.1080/01495933.2015.994405|pub.1019517436|3;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|International Security|2006|30|4|7-44|10.1162/isec.2006.30.4.7|pub.1025314466|62;[Beres, Louis René]|[ur.012277140031.43]|World Politics|1981|34|1|25-46|10.2307/2010149|pub.1031309017|4;[Khoo, Nicholas; Steff, Reuben]|[ur.07621626701.96; ur.014600705231.49]|Defense and Security Analysis|2014|30|1|17-28|10.1080/14751798.2013.864869|pub.1031798596|5;[Steff, Reuben]|[ur.014600705231.49]|Contemporary Security Policy|2013|34|1|94-119|10.1080/13523260.2013.771035|pub.1032947035|2;[Norris, Robbert S.; Kristensen, Hans M.]|[; ur.010537156661.63]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2010|66|4|77-83|10.2968/066004008|pub.1033622122|28;[Steff, Reuben]|[ur.014600705231.49]||2016||||10.4324/9781315610962|pub.1035246449|2;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]||2003||||10.1057/9780230379435|pub.1035730468|74;[Tang, Shiping]|[]|Security Studies|2009|18|3|587-623|10.1080/09636410903133050|pub.1039655800|49;[Knopf, Jeffrey W.]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2010|31|1|1-33|10.1080/13523261003640819|pub.1053308175|47;[Lebow, Richard Ned; Stein, Janice Gross]|[ur.011434531375.46; ur.013222707512.19]|Political Science Quarterly|1995|110|2|157|10.2307/2152358|pub.1069792357|18;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|International Security|2017|41|4|9-49|10.1162/isec_a_00273|pub.1085062036|43;[Litwak, Robert S.]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2017|40|1|55-70|10.1080/0163660x.2017.1302739|pub.1085275985|1;[Altmann, Jürgen; Sauer, Frank]|[; ]|Survival|2017|59|5|117-142|10.1080/00396338.2017.1375263|pub.1091827255|41;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|Foreign Affairs|2006|85|2|42|10.2307/20031910|pub.1102750588|30;[Wohlstetter, Albert]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1959|37|2|211|10.2307/20029345|pub.1102763664|138"

It begins by reviewing the concept of deterrence, followed by an examination of each nuclear-weapon State’s present stance on nuclear deterrence within its respective military doctrine. It subsequently looks at the requirements under Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) moving to explore concerns regarding disarmament matters, noting the continued reliance on deterrence as a central feature of military protection and defence doctrine. Instead of deterrence becoming an out-dated concept that should have expired with the Cold War, it remains the status quo, despite requirements to the contrary under Article VI of the NPT.",Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume V,2020,,,323-350,"Black-Branch, Jonathan",University of Manitoba,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123788967,0,"[Cioffi-Revilla, Claudio]|[ur.013027716224.13]|Cross-Cultural Research|1999|33|3|239-264|10.1177/106939719903300302|pub.1002101264|5;[Norris, Robert S.; Kristensen, Hans M.]|[ur.012753062546.31; ur.014521466007.50]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2013|69|4|69-75|10.1177/0096340213493260|pub.1020939924|9;[Gerson, Michael S.]|[]||2009||||10.21236/ada510428|pub.1091542447|6;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]||2003||||10.1017/cbo9780511491573|pub.1098665879|78;[Ruff, Tilman]|[ur.0577177343.62]|Global Change Peace & Security|2018|30|2|1-9|10.1080/14781158.2018.1465908|pub.1103687788|6;[Docherty, Bonnie]|[]|Global Change Peace & Security|2018|30|2|1-24|10.1080/14781158.2018.1472075|pub.1103884514|6;[Poettcker, Jason]|[]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume IV|2019|||297-323|10.1007/978-94-6265-267-5_14|pub.1110786143|1;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Korda, Matt]|[ur.014521466007.50; ur.07634451624.98]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2019|75|2|73-84|10.1080/00963402.2019.1580891|pub.1112564584|11;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Korda, Matt]|[ur.014521466007.50; ur.07634451624.98]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2019|75|3|122-134|10.1080/00963402.2019.1606503|pub.1113811911|3"

Cyber intelligence plays a vital role in the balance of power. Most importantly, this paper explores previous studies of the International Relations (IR) theory of Realism. Cybersecurity can be applied as the equivalent of a nuclear deterrent of Realism and is inspired by the sense of the threat that allied countries felt in regard to cybersecurity. Countries utilize capacity building for military affairs, economics, and administration for cyber deterrence. Even though the circumstances of cybersecurity are deeply affected by the deterrence theory of Realism, concepts of capacity building for cybersecurity are derived not only from Realism but also from Liberalism and Constructivism. In the end, through this paper, I found that there is an interdependence of Realism, Liberalism, and Constructivism.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2020,590,,222-232,"Watanabe, Seiko",Yokohama National University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132544385,0,"[Rid, Thomas]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|1|5-32|10.1080/01402390.2011.608939|pub.1012160244|189;[]|[]||2014||||10.1007/978-3-642-37481-4|pub.1023830655|16;[Echebarria, Carmen; Barrutia, Jose M.; Aguado, Itziar]|[ur.011052314376.48; ur.014761235407.88; ur.016354176407.55]|European Urban and Regional Studies|2004|11|3|273-281|10.1177/0969776404041490|pub.1047208910|27;[Min, Kyoung-Sik; Chai, Seung-Woan; Han, Mijeong]|[ur.016015125627.67; ur.010330025051.00; ur.010107435027.10]|International Journal of Security and Its Applications|2015|9|2|13-20|10.14257/ijsia.2015.9.2.02|pub.1067239865|8;[Herman, Michael]|[]||1996||||10.1017/cbo9780511521737|pub.1098706771|136;[]|[]||2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2229.001.0001|pub.1110616926|19"

pub.1122230276,10.1007/978-94-6265-343-6_2,The Status of Nuclear Deterrence Under International Law in Light of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,"Nuclear deterrence is not illegal under international law but is being delegitimised, in part as a result of the adoption of the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The Treaty prohibits not only possession, control over, threat of use, and use of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; it also precludes a state party from encouraging and assisting anyone to engage in such prohibited activities. Moreover, artificial intelligence, offensive cyber operations, and enhanced non-nuclear weapons with strategic impact are combining to render nuclear deterrents ineffective while greatly increasing the risks of unintended or accidental use. Conflict in February 2019 between two nuclear-armed states, India and Pakistan, has shown the dangers and frailties of nuclear deterrence. Nonetheless, nuclear-armed states are engaging in major nuclear weapon modernisation programmes, resulting in a new nuclear arms race. This new race is characterised by the development and deployment of hypersonic missiles containing multiple independently targetable warheads as well as by variable-yield nuclear weapons.

This chapter examines the challenges and opportunities Canada faces in applying deterrence by punishment, denial and delegitimization to space and cyberspace. Building off American approaches to deterrence in both of these emerging strategic domains and with a focus on doctrine and policy, we outline a Canadian approach to space and cyber deterrence that recognizes Canadian limitations, builds on Canadian strengths and serves Canadian interests. We argue that Canada must develop international norms of responsible behaviour in space and cyberspace to help curb certain behaviour (delegitimization), work with allies and the private sector to develop space and cyber systems that are resilient to attack (denial) and explore the utility of retaliatory measures—kinetic or otherwise—in both domains (punishment). By way of conclusion, we suggest Canada place greater attention to the strategic interplay between space, cyberspace and other traditional military domains and re-examine the perennial debate between defence autonomy and integration as it relates to the relationship between American and Canadian deterrence in space and cyberspace.",Canada and International Affairs,2020,,,399-416,"McKeown, Ryder; Wilner, Alex",University of Toronto; Carleton University,Canada; Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120844304,0,"[DeBlois, Bruce M.; Garwin, Richard L.; Kemp, R.

The TPNW, while contributing to a nuclear taboo, is insufficient as institutional foundation for achieving and maintaining a peaceful world without nuclear weapons.

pub.1123786347,10.1007/978-94-6265-347-4_17,Legal Aspects of Nuclear Weapons Doctrines,"Whilst the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) requires States to take effective measures for a cessation of the nuclear arms race, and the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) calls for a near-term prohibition of nuclear armament, these goals are far from being fulfilled. Nuclear deterrence remains a reality in current State practice, NPT implementation is under stress, and all nuclear-armed States are unwilling to join the TPNW. This chapter undertakes a legal review of published nuclear doctrines in an effort to explore global and regional aspects of the role of nuclear weapons today: are current activities towards nuclear weapons modernization and further improvements of missiles and missile defence compatible with obligations under international law? Will modernization increase or decrease the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence? Are there gaps relating to negative security assurances in pertinent regions and what are the prospects for closing them? Are the existing international monitoring and control mechanisms sufficient and what may be done for their improvement? What other means could support confidence building? The author concludes that certain specific activities of nuclear weapons modernization and the development of missiles technology remain problematic under international legal principles and rules. A special focus is laid on low-yield nuclear warheads that would hardly be limited to an extreme case of self-defence in which the very survival of a State would be at stake, as well as on high-yield nuclear warheads with a devastation capacity that may exceed any standard of necessity and proportionality.",Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume V,2020,,,351-391,"Fleck, Dieter",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123786347,0,"[Lewis, Jeffrey G.; Sagan, Scott D.]|[; ]|Daedalus|2016|145|4|62-74|10.1162/daed_a_00412|pub.1002525696|5;[Rauf, Tariq; Jadoon, Usman Iqbal]|[; ]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume III|2016|||113-145|10.1007/978-94-6265-138-8_4|pub.1021872527|1;[Bauer, Sabine; O’Reilly, Cormac]|[; ]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law|2016|||131-150|10.1007/978-94-6265-075-6_6|pub.1025899792|6;[Haupt, Dirk Roland]|[]|Nuclear Non-Proliferation in International Law - Volume III|2016|||403-469|10.1007/978-94-6265-138-8_13|pub.1027281724|1;[Hellestveit, Cecilie; Mekonnen, Daniel]|[ur.010057153221.95; ]|Nuclear Weapons under International Law|2014|||347-373|10.1017/cbo9781107337435.023|pub.1048093909|2;[Kristensen, Hans M.; McKinzie, Matthew G.]|[ur.014521466007.50; ]|International Review of the Red Cross|2015|97|899|563-599|10.1017/s1816383116000308|pub.1049799908|1;[Asada, M.]|[]|Journal of Conflict and Security Law|2002|7|1|85-122|10.1093/jcsl/7.1.85|pub.1059754062|6;[Tabassi, L.]|[]|Journal of Conflict and Security Law|2009|14|2|309-352|10.1093/jcsl/krp026|pub.1059754232|5;[]|[]|Choice|2015|52|08|52-4464-52-4464|10.5860/choice.185963|pub.1073275908|17;[Mackby, Jenifer]|[ur.013100450543.38]|The Nonproliferation Review|2016|23|3-4|261-286|10.1080/10736700.2016.1290026|pub.1084163956|4;[Larsen, Paul B]|[]|Journal of Conflict and Security Law|2018|23|1|137-159|10.1093/jcsl/krw026|pub.1084185581|3;[Black-Branch, Jonathan]|[]|Journal of Conflict and Security Law|2017|22|2|201-248|10.1093/jcsl/krx004|pub.1085663522|3;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[ur.014521466007.50; ur.012753062546.31]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2017|73|4|205-209|10.1080/00963402.2017.1337998|pub.1090553914|8;[Zysk, Katarzyna]|[]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2017|73|5|1-6|10.1080/00963402.2017.1362908|pub.1091314051|3;[Narang, Vipin]|[]||2014||||10.1515/9781400850402|pub.1096117677|28;[Kalshoven, Frits; Zegveld, Liesbeth]|[; ]||2011||||10.1017/cbo9780511995231|pub.1098662838|39;[Henckaerts, Jean-Marie; Doswald-Beck, Louise; Alvermann, Carolin; Dörmann, Knut; Rolle, Baptiste]|[; ur.014017430424.19; ; ur.015412371424.71; ur.016207752024.99]||2005||||10.1017/cbo9780511804700|pub.1098663688|466;[Quinlan, Michael]|[]||2009||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199563944.001.0001|pub.1098730989|16;[Stürchler, Nikolas]|[ur.016712732535.32]||2007||||10.1017/cbo9780511494338|pub.1098739941|15;[Sundaram, Kumar; Ramana, M.

Therefore, like the concept of containment, deterrence has not been assessed rigorously as a viable strategic tool within the conventional conflict spectrum. Furthermore, the use of empirical historical analysis as the means of providing that assessment has also been absent from considerations regarding the utility of deterrence in the modern international security environment. Finally, deterrence has most often been associated with the threat of the use of military power being the mechanism by which changed or deterred behaviour is achieved (Gaddis 2005; Heuser 1998, pp. 311–328; Tarock 2016, pp. 1408–1424; Milevski 2016). Through an analysis of British and American economic and fiscal policies from 1937 to 1941, aimed at deterring Japan from disrupting the balance of power system in place in the Far East that protected their imperial possessions in the region, a better appreciation of non-military deterrence is achieved (Lacey 2015).",Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,2020,,,177-191,"Kennedy, Greg",King's College London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124123542,0,"[O'Leary, James P.]|[]|Comparative Strategy|1985|5|2|179-206|10.1080/01495938508402688|pub.1004841301|5;[Tarock, Adam]|[]|Third World Quarterly|2016|37|8|1-17|10.1080/01436597.2016.1166049|pub.1010900812|4;[Asada, Sadao]|[]|Diplomatic History|2006|30|2|211-230|10.1111/j.1467-7709.2006.00547.x|pub.1012953638|4;[NISH, IAN]|[]|Diplomacy and Statecraft|2004|15|1|149-161|10.1080/09592290490438114|pub.1022462731|1;[Van Alstyne, Richard W.]|[]|Pacific Historical Review|1947|16|4|429-436|10.2307/3635859|pub.1024454636|9;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2005|28|5|789-801|10.1080/01402390500393944|pub.1033267850|4;[Kennedy, Greg]|[]|Defence Studies|2008|8|2|190-206|10.1080/14702430802099342|pub.1037515451|1;[Kennedy, Greg]|[]|Intelligence & National Security|2007|22|5|699-721|10.1080/02684520701718120|pub.1040783680|1;[Park, Tae Jin]|[]|Diplomacy and Statecraft|2011|22|3|388-407|10.1080/09592296.2011.599637|pub.1045304644|4;[Haslam, Jonathan]|[]||1992||||10.1007/978-1-349-05679-8|pub.1048292564|12;[Knopf, Jeffrey W.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|3|375-399|10.1080/01402390.2011.643567|pub.1050213877|11;[Heuser, Beatrice]|[]|Contemporary European History|1998|7|3|311-327|10.1017/s0960777300004264|pub.1054010099|10;[Clemens, Jeffrey]|[]|American Economic Review|2013|103|3|523-527|10.1257/aer.103.3.523|pub.1064525999|7;[Meilinger, Phillip S.]|[ur.07700015711.16]|The Journal of Military History|2000|64|2|467|10.2307/120248|pub.1069395356|9;[McDermott, John]|[]|Canadian Journal of History|1986|21|1|61-76|10.3138/cjh.21.1.61|pub.1071006094|4;[FAO]|[]|The State of Food and Agriculture|1953|23|Suppl 3|6-7|10.18356/ce0fad9b-en|pub.1083675271|14;[McDonald, J.

pub.1125561925,10.1007/978-3-030-28285-1_7,Artificial Intelligence and Warfare,"New developments in Artificial Intelligence may overshadow the traditional foundation of nuclear deterrence by reducing the survivability of missile launch platforms. AI has the capability to gather and quickly synthesize information from thousands of sources to produce highly accurate estimates of locations for missile-submarines, or land-based mobile launchers. Thus, mobile nuclear assets for deterrence may become easier targets, which reduces the threat of successful retaliation after a deliberate first-strike. Other traditional forms of defense may also be rendered obsolete. While traditional defenses are designed to protect against larger, stronger weapons, AI has the new capability to operate autonomous weapons at the miniaturized level. Miniature devices can fly toward a target undetected and then swarm together at the last minute to deliver a powerful, coordinated blow through autonomous synchronization. Many critics encourage policy makers to prevent AI weapons from ever killing humans as part of a military mission without first receiving explicit permission from a human operator. However, other experts warn that AI may someday evolve beyond submission to their human controllers, and may independently and dynamically set up their own new missions and goals which may conflict with the original designers. AI is currently an area of intense research for China and Russia. Moral objections to AI by contractor-technicians in the US may slow new development by the DOD. However, US commercial development of AI is moving forward rapidly, and can be seen in new products such as self-driving cars. AI may be considered a dual-use technology, similar to strong encryption, which makes legal controls to limit uses and prevent export somewhat difficult.",21st Century Prometheus,2020,,,125-140,"Wilson, Clay","University of Maryland, College Park",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125561925,0,"[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|International Security|2017|41|4|9-49|10.1162/isec_a_00273|pub.1085062036|43"

It seems that the BMDS provides a false sense of security to India. For this reason it is felt that the Cold Start Doctrine (CSD) can therefore be launched against Pakistan in an attempt to actualize a disarming strike. Consequentially, the BMDS disturbs the India-Pakistan crisis and deterrence stability. Indian policymakers should realize that firstly, the operationalization of the CSD crosses Pakistan’s nuclear threshold and it requires Islamabad to unleash strategic and tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs); secondly, the Pak-India crisis and deterrence stability is functional due to the sense of mutual vulnerability; thirdly, the credibility of nuclear deterrence has not been tested and fourthly, the deterrence stability solidified the crisis and strategic stability. The BMDS deployment in South Asia will certainly result first in quantitative and qualitative nuclear proliferation; second, it weakens the NPT and; third, it may break the nuclear taboo based on non-use of nuclear weapons.

pub.1123311463,,A Stable Nuclear Future? The Impact of Autonomous Systems and Artificial   Intelligence,"The potential for advances in information-age technologies to undermine nuclear deterrence and influence the potential for nuclear escalation represents a critical question for international politics. One challenge is that uncertainty about the trajectory of technologies such as autonomous systems and artificial intelligence (AI) makes assessments difficult. This paper evaluates the relative impact of autonomous systems and artificial intelligence in three areas: nuclear command and control, nuclear delivery platforms and vehicles, and conventional applications of autonomous systems with consequences for nuclear stability. We argue that countries may be more likely to use risky forms of autonomy when they fear that their second-strike capabilities will be undermined. Additionally, the potential deployment of uninhabited, autonomous nuclear delivery platforms and vehicles could raise the prospect for accidents and miscalculation. Conventional military applications of autonomous systems could simultaneously influence nuclear force postures and first-strike stability in previously unanticipated ways. In particular, the need to fight at machine speed and the cognitive risk introduced by automation bias could increase the risk of unintended escalation. Finally, used properly, there should be many applications of more autonomous systems in nuclear operations that can increase reliability, reduce the risk of accidents, and buy more time for decision-makers in a crisis.",arXiv,2019,,,,"Horowitz, Michael C.; Scharre, Paul; Velez-Green, Alexander",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123311463,0,

This article found that hybrid warfare has an erosion like effect on nuclear deterrence because it increases the likelihood that nuclear weapons will be used. This may be due to both the fact that hybrid warfare can ignore conventional redlines, but also because the cyber aspect of hybrid warfare has unintended psychological effects on how deterrence functions. how does this relate to nuclear war? In short, cyber warfare attacks key concepts which make nuclear deterrence a viable strategy including the concepts of stability, clarity, and rationality.

It has been widely argued that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has shown strong interest in launching large-scale cyberattacks against the US during warfare or peacetime. However, such views ignore the fact that the PLA must restrain itself due to the uncertainties of cyberattack, such as collateral damage, blowback, and escalation. In fact, Chinese experts follow US perceptions and cyberwar practices very closely, which has contributed to Beijing’s evolving strategic thinking over the past decades. From the 1990s to early 2000s, the “ideology of offense” was the PLA’s primary approach to the “informationization leaping forward”. Due to the shock of the Gulf War, most of the military strategists advocated cyber offense in order to catch up with the new round of revolution in military affairs. However, after 2008, both military and civilian experts started to increasingly question the effectiveness of cyberattack after studying their peers’ criticism against cyber deterrence in the US.

It addresses the contemporary developments in three interconnected domains: first-strike, crisis and arms race stability. It traces the evolution of strategic stability studies, highlights the most fundamental contribution in the three above-mentioned study areas, and attempts to explain the change in contemporary nuclear deterrence. During the Cold War the superpowers developed international practices and unwritten rules of nuclear deterrence. Political practices emerged together with extensive studies of nuclear deterrence, which were based on a rational choice approach and game modelling. Contemporary international relations (IR) faces revival of nuclear deterrence studies. While some scholars are rediscovering the Cold War IR analysis models and adapting them to contemporary realities, others are looking for new analytical possibilities. This article focuses upon interlinkages between first-strike, crisis and arms race stability, and attempts to explain how changes in strategic environment can help better understanding the contemporary nuclear deterrence. It discusses whether and under what conditions nuclear parity, first-strike stability, arms control and crisis equilibrium can guarantee the strategic stability and military balance. It also addresses the qualitative or quantitative change in the conflict or crisis perception, and its implications on contemporary deterrence.",Lithuanian Annual Strategic Review,2019,17,1,97-121,"Karpavičiūtė, Ieva",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127394955,0,
pub.1124361649,10.1080/14736489.2019.1703364,Managing the 1986-87 Sino-Indian Sumdorong Chu Crisis,"How did China and India manage to prevent the 1986-87 Sumdorong Chu Crisis from escalating into a war? I argue that it was a combination of changing geopolitical factors (Sino-Soviet rapprochement and the end of Soviet support for India in the context of Sino-Indian tensions) and military factors (conventional deterrence and perceptions of limited revisionism) that help explain crisis management. While these geopolitical and military factors helped avert immediate escalation, the crisis truly ended only after China and India sought a new modus vivendi during Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s landmark trip to China in December 1988. The absence of great power (Soviet) support meant that India had to make a costly signal to China in the form of Gandhi’s trip that happened during the 1987-89 cycle of protests in Tibet against Chinese rule. Nevertheless, Gandhi’s visit took place after India had demonstrated its military strength and resolve in its ability to defend the status quo on the border, and therefore should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness. In other words, I argue that successful deterrence requires broader foreign policy reorientation. At the same time, considerations of power (in the form of internal/external balancing) are central to strategic stability in the Sino-Indian dyad, and that any recourse to diplomacy that ignores the realities of military power is unlikely to be successful for crisis management.",India Review,2019,18,5,534-551,"Pardesi, Manjeet S.",Victoria University of Wellington,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124361649,1,

In doing so, this paper elaborates various innovative measures that could be applicable to South Asian nuclear environment that in turn could assist the South Asian nuclear leadership in understanding and managing the fragility of South Asian nuclear deterrence.   Design/methodology/approach Innovatively, this research paper looks at the South Asian nuclear issues at three levels of analysis – understanding the prevailing dynamics of nuclear revolution and improved means of communications and promoting deterrence stability in South Asia. All three levels may be more needed than ever before in the wake of the arrival of nuclear weapons for a broader Southern Asian region.   Findings This paper finds out that although nuclear weapons have become a reality in South Asia and these deadly weapons have prevented major wars between India and Pakistan, nuclear weapons have not prevented the crises between India and Pakistan. Therefore, both India and Pakistan have confronted a number of crises. The paper finds out that any serious crisis between India and Pakistan could further undermine the credibility of existing confidence-building measures and the same could escalate from military to nuclear level. Absent from immediate measures undertaken by the South Asian security leadership, nuclear weapons may not help prevent the war between India and Pakistan at the sub-conventional level, this paper finds out.   Originality/value By explaining innovative measures at the three level of analysis, this papers adds to the existing literature in understanding the behavior of South Asian security leadership and how these measures could best bring positive results in preventing a major crisis that potentially bears the risk of escalation to nuclear level.",International Journal of Conflict Management,2019,30,5,589-614,"Khan, Zafar",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117411861,0,"[Wilson, Ward]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|2008|15|3|421-439|10.1080/10736700802407101|pub.1014523149|13;[Biswas, Arka]|[ur.015727011354.46]|Strategic Analysis|2015|39|6|683-695|10.1080/09700161.2015.1090682|pub.1024838378|3;[Montgomery, Evan Braden; Edelman, Eric S.]|[ur.015471165420.06; ]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2015|38|1-2|159-182|10.1080/01402390.2014.901215|pub.1028442296|6;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[ur.014521466007.50; ur.012753062546.31]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2016|72|6|368-376|10.1080/00963402.2016.1241520|pub.1028758025|6;[Sankaran, Jaganath]|[ur.014754176175.91]|International Security|2015|39|3|118-151|10.1162/isec_a_00191|pub.1038055710|22;[Ladwig, Walter C.]|[ur.014031057715.41]|International Security|2008|32|3|158-190|10.1162/isec.2008.32.3.158|pub.1048968283|35;[Thayer, Bradley A.]|[ur.013110745341.44]|Security Studies|1994|3|3|428-493|10.1080/09636419409347557|pub.1049278010|18;[Rosenberg, David Alan]|[]|International Security|1983|7|4|3|10.2307/2626731|pub.1070041581|126;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[ur.014521466007.50; ur.012753062546.31]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2017|73|4|205-209|10.1080/00963402.2017.1337998|pub.1090553914|8;[Perkovich, George]|[]|Foreign Policy|1993||91|85|10.2307/1149061|pub.1102458618|22;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|Foreign Policy|2002||133|40|10.2307/3183553|pub.1102460281|11;[Bundy, McGeorge]|[ur.014550420323.30]|Foreign Affairs|1969|48|1|1|10.2307/20039419|pub.1102752748|33"
pub.1117966627,10.1080/09662839.2019.1637855,Proving a negative: why deterrence does not work in the Baltics,"The increased Russian foreign policy assertiveness and the related security concerns associated with the Eastern Flank of NATO caused a revival of interest in European deterrence after more than two decades of neglect. Yet the absence of a military invasion into the Baltics does not necessarily imply a successful deterrent threat. Quite the contrary: a detailed analysis using Boolean logic suggests that deterrence does not really work in the Baltics, neither at the conventional, nor at the sub-conventional level. A lack of capabilities undermines the credibility of NATO’s conventional deterrence posture despite its clear effort to communicate the threat to the other side. The only reason why the lack of capabilities on the Eastern Flank has no negative consequences for the Alliance is because Russia has (currently) no need to advance its state interests by resorting to military force. At the same time, deterrence fails repeatedly at the sub-conventional level and it will probably continue to fail in the future. Incidents like the relocation of the Bronze Soldier Memorial in 2007, the kidnapping of a security officer in 2014 or the violations of airspace in 2018 can escalate to a full-blown crisis.

Firstly, this article will explore the development of its advanced nuclear weapons by both qualitative and quantitative methods by examining how the Kim Jong Un regime made the decision to accelerate its nuclear development and then put it into practice. Secondly, I will review how the Trump administration and the Kim Jong Un regime changed their perceptions of each other after North Korea proved its ability to invulnerably attack the US mainland and its allies through its advancement of nuclear weapons. Finally, the survivability of the Kim Jong Un regime will be considered according to its analytical framework, namely the nuclear deterrence theory. Based on these verification results where the DPRK’s survivability has been consolidated in a military sense and crisis stability between the US and the DPRK has been improved, this article also clarifies implications for North Korea’s new security strategy, regional studies on the DPRK, and Nuclear Deterrence Theory itself.",,2019,1,,73-94,"CHOI, Jung Hoon",Ritsumeikan University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127547959,0,"[Treverton, Gregory F.; Jervis, Robert]|[; ]|Foreign Affairs|1989|68|5|207|10.2307/20044214|pub.1102756918|26"
pub.1103849321,10.1057/s41311-018-0157-x,Reassessing Chilean international security,"In this paper, I offer a neorealist interpretation of Chile’s pursuit of security in the Southern Andean Cone in Latin America. I challenge current liberal institutionalist interpretations to shed light on the mounting evidence suggesting Chile’s strong sense of interstate rivalry and competition for power with its regional neighbours. Since the turn of the century, relations with Peru and Bolivia are at a low considering the recent demands in The Hague over territorial bargaining, and, unlike the amicable bilateral relations that have developed recently with long-time rival Argentina, Chile’s interactions with Lima and La Paz reveal the use of purposeful alliances, military deterrence, and diplomatic means to balance each other’s strategic advantages. Against this backdrop, the paper provides with explanatory power to understand Chile’s overall mistrust of Latin America’s rebellious security scenario as it breaks through the theoretical ceiling of current Southern Cone international politics studies.",International Politics,2019,56,5,569-584,"Solar, Carlos",University of Oxford,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103849321,2,"[Solar, Carlos]|[ur.011073676456.08]|Democracy and Security|2015|11|4|373-394|10.1080/17419166.2015.1098540|pub.1000567772|6;[RIGGIROZZI, PÍA; GRUGEL, JEAN]|[ur.012550664276.37; ur.07756305031.70]|International Affairs|2015|91|4|781-797|10.1111/1468-2346.12340|pub.1001752247|15;[Díaz, Emilio José Ugarte]|[]|Si Somos Americanos|2014|14|2|159-185|10.4067/s0719-09482014000200007|pub.1003774400|1;[Tickner, Arlene]|[]|Millennium Journal of International Studies|2003|32|2|295-324|10.1177/03058298030320020301|pub.1003868433|108;[Hassner, Ron E.]|[ur.010436647437.97]|International Security|2007|31|3|107-138|10.1162/isec.2007.31.3.107|pub.1004302199|32;[Oelsner, Andrea]|[ur.014540051207.68]|Security Dialogue|2009|40|2|191-212|10.1177/0967010609103086|pub.1004611164|24;[Mearsheimer, John J.]|[]|International Relations|2009|23|2|241-256|10.1177/0047117809104637|pub.1007394304|37;[Parent, Joseph M.; Rosato, Sebastian]|[; ]|International Security|2015|40|2|51-86|10.1162/isec_a_00216|pub.1007909053|15;[Chipman, John; Smith, James Lockhart]|[; ]|Survival|2009|51|6|77-104|10.1080/00396330903461690|pub.1008016914|2;[Avilés, William]|[]||2010||||10.1057/9780230115446|pub.1009073941|1;[Solar, Carlos]|[ur.011073676456.08]|Latin American Policy|2015|6|2|205-225|10.1111/lamp.12078|pub.1009519028|5;[Herz, Monica]|[ur.010562651355.75]|International Peacekeeping|2010|17|5|598-612|10.1080/13533312.2010.516938|pub.1011759185|11;[Castillo, Rodrigo Morales; Maldonado, Gerardo; Schiavon, Jorge A.]|[ur.011245111147.45; ; ur.012640052147.31]|Latin American Policy|2015|6|1|2-18|10.1111/lamp.12062|pub.1012131033|6;[Weiffen, Brigitte]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2012|33|2|360-383|10.1080/13523260.2012.693801|pub.1014086862|4;[Mearsheimer, John]|[]|Security Studies|2011|20|3|424-430|10.1080/09636412.2011.599190|pub.1019367948|5;[Diamint, Rut]|[ur.014465763513.00]|Bulletin of Latin American Research|2004|23|1|43-62|10.1111/j.1470-9856.2004.00095.x|pub.1019410699|12;[Resende-Santos, João]|[ur.015377446477.56]|Latin American Politics and Society|2002|44|4|89-126|10.1111/j.1548-2456.2002.tb00224.x|pub.1019475084|7;[Giacalone, Rita]|[ur.012453725735.16]|Foreign Policy Analysis|2012|8|4|335-354|10.1111/j.1743-8594.2011.00176.x|pub.1021214145|39;[Taliaferro, Jeffrey W.]|[ur.012524131503.72]|International Security|2001|25|3|128-161|10.1162/016228800560543|pub.1022405802|105;[Buszynski, Leszek]|[]|Asian Survey|2002|42|3|483-501|10.1525/as.2002.42.3.483|pub.1026626267|5;[Villa, Rafael A.

pub.1122390341,10.15366/relacionesinternacionales2019.42.011,Desarmar al ‘bárbaro’: Occidente y la cruzada contra la proliferación nuclear en Oriente Medio,"The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in force since 1970 legitimized the Western thesis that some states are more rational and stable than others to possess a nuclear arsenal. Although the differences between states exist, a binary division between a civilized and rational world and another barbaric and irrational one does not contribute to explaining the diversity of phenomena in the international arena, rather, it hinders that possibility. The War on Terrorism, declared by the United States in 2001, exacerbated its ethnocentric strategic stance and allowed it to implement disproportionate nuclear counterproliferation policies and actions in countries such as Iraq, Libya and Iran. Based on the analysis on ethnocentrism and security of the British theorist of International Relations, Ken Booth, this article explains the contradictions of the western dichotomous narrative in reference to nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, synthesized in three postulates: first, nuclear deterrence it is not possible due to the political instability of the actors; second, the countries of the Middle East lack technical capabilities for the maintenance of nuclear weapons and third, nuclear military spending undermines the full development of these countries.",Relaciones Internacionales,2019,,42,197-217,"ÁLVAREZ, Cristina Valeria PUGA",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122390341,0,"[KELLNER, DOUGLAS]|[]|Presidential Studies Quarterly|2007|37|4|622-645|10.1111/j.1741-5705.2007.02617.x|pub.1003326526|35;[Smith, M.

pub.1121092259,10.1017/s1479244319000271,Keynes Goes Nuclear: Thomas Schelling and the Macroeconomic Origins of Strategic Stability,"Among the most important ideas in Cold War nuclear strategy and arms control was that of “stability”—the notion that by protecting weapons for use in retaliation, the superpowers would be less likely to fight a thermonuclear war. Conventional wisdom among strategists and historians of strategy has long held that stability was inherent to the logic of rational nuclear deterrence. This essay shows the conventional wisdom to be mistaken. It examines the technical practice of Thomas Schelling, who introduced the stability idea in a classic 1958 paper. Celebrated as a game theorist, Schelling was actually trained as a Keynesian macroeconomic modeler during the second half of the 1940s. In 1958, he used Keynesian techniques to frame deterrence as a stable system of dynamic adjustment, akin to the stable macroeconomic system he had modeled as a young economist.

Recent evidence indicates that these postures are far more integrated, flexible, and dynamic than Beijing’s official rhetoric suggests, and that during the past decade a de facto shift toward a limited nuclear war-fighting posture has already taken place. By applying an International Relations (IR) structural-realist lens to conceptualize a relatively under-researched discourse that relates to recent indications that China is contemplating the deployment of nuclear weapons for war-fighting (or victory-denial) purposes. A radical doctrinal shift of this kind (or even the perception of one) could presage a paradigm shift in China’s long-standing nuclear posture and the nuclear balance in Asia.",Asian Security,2019,15,3,1-18,"Johnson, James Samuel",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101349221,1,
pub.1125923396,10.1080/10736700.2019.1737409,Pakistan’s nuclear future: continued dependence on asymmetric escalation,"In 2019, the geostrategic landscape of South Asia significantly changed. A crisis between India and Pakistan involved air strikes across international boundaries for the first time since the 1971 war. Pakistan came close to economic collapse, while India re-elected hawkish Narendra Modi as prime minister in a landslide. These developments, alongside the United States’ efforts to strike a deal to leave Afghanistan and rapidly improving US-India relations, portend new challenges for Pakistan’s security managers—challenges that nuclear weapons are ill-suited to address. Despite the shifting security and political situation in the region, however, Pakistan’s nuclear posture and doctrine seem unlikely to change. This article explores the roots of Pakistan’s reliance on the traditional predictions of the nuclear revolution, most notably the notion that nuclear-armed states will not go to war with one another, and argues that this reliance on nuclear deterrence is a response both to Pakistan’s security environment and to serious constraints on moving away from nuclear weapons toward an improved conventional force posture. Pakistan’s central problems remain the same as when it first contemplated nuclear weapons: the threat from India, the absence of true allies, a weak state and a weaker economy, and few friends in the international system. While 2019 may have been a turning point for other states in the region, Pakistan is likely to stay the course.",The Nonproliferation Review,2019,26,5-6,449-463,"Wueger, Diana",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125923396,0,
pub.1123198466,10.1109/allerton.2019.8919910,A Cyber-Nuclear Deterrence Game,"The reliability of nuclear command, control and communications has long been identified as a critical component of the strategic stability among nuclear states. Advances in offensive cyber weaponry have the potential to negatively impact this reliability, threatening strategic stability. In this paper we present a game theoretic model of preemptive cyber attacks against nuclear command, control and communications. The model is a modification of the classic two-player game of Chicken, a standard game theoretic model for nuclear brinksmanship. We fully characterize equilibria in both the complete information game and two distinct two-sided incomplete information games. We show that when both players have advanced cyber capabilities conflict is more likely in equilibrium, regardless of information structure. On the other hand, when at most one player has advanced cyber capabilities, strategic stability depends on the information structure. Under complete information, asymmetric cyber capabilities have a stabilizing effect in which the player with strong cyber has the resolve to stand firm in equilibrium. Under incomplete information, asymmetric cyber capabilities can have both stabilizing and destabilizing effects depending on prior beliefs over opponent cyber capabilities.","2019 57th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)",2019,00,,470-479,"Soper, Braden C.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123198466,0,"[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[ur.016123225213.98]|Journal of Cybersecurity|2015|1|1|53-67|10.1093/cybsec/tyv003|pub.1039177182|34;[Bruns, Bryan Randolph]|[]|Games|2015|6|4|495-520|10.3390/g6040495|pub.1046570993|7;[Gartzke, Erik; Lindsay, Jon R.]|[ur.014753037012.98; ur.016123225213.98]|Security Studies|2015|24|2|316-348|10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188|pub.1052004488|40;[Gartzke, Erik; Lindsay, Jon R.]|[ur.014753037012.98; ur.016123225213.98]|Journal of Cybersecurity|2017|||tyw017-|10.1093/cybsec/tyw017|pub.1083827234|12;[Van Puyvelde, Damien; Brantly, Aaron F.]|[ur.015605570403.51; ur.016106672055.44]||2017||||10.4324/9781315225623|pub.1090926209|4;[Soper, Braden; Musacchio, John]|[ur.015064306313.48; ur.013330670275.71]|2015 53rd Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)|2015|||361-371|10.1109/allerton.2015.7447027|pub.1093938870|4"

It concludes: (a) deterrence is a threat; (b) a threat is unlawful if use of the threatened force would be unlawful; (c) the only possible exception to the general rule that use of nuclear weapons would be unlawful is an extreme circumstance of self-defence; (d) use of nuclear weapons in a belligerent reprisal would be unlawful; and so (e) two specific aspects of UK policy are unlawful: the refusal to rule out first use, and the possibility of low level, high power use. Possible strategies to hold the UK to account are considered, and paragraphs 47–8 of the ICJ's Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion are dissected in an appendix.

This NATO approach advanced cohesion among allies, some of which were politically uncomfortable with if not borderline opposed to nuclear deterrence. Allied comfort is now under siege, however. Russian military doctrine threatens the early use of nuclear weapons, and states such as Iran and North Korea expose fault lines in the nuclear arms control regime that in recent years has sought to further the full abolition of nuclear weapons.

While the tenets of classical deterrence theory are difficult to apply to cyberspace, understanding the applicability of these concepts in the cyber context is crucial as cyberspace continues to transform into a prominent domain of conflict. Classical deterrence has always been closely associated with a Cold War-era nuclear context, and its translation to cyberspace will require a broader approach to account for changes in the nature of the domain. The success of Estonia’s multi-faceted deterrence efforts after experiencing a large-scale cyber-attack in 2007 shows the effectiveness of such a conception of deterrence to the realm of cyberspace, through the implementation of international and domestic level policies.

Supporters believe these actions should significantly reduce attacks against the United States, while critics worry that they may incite more adversary activity. As there is no standard methodology to measure which is the case, this paper introduces a transparent framework to better assess whether the new U.S. policy and actions are suppressing or encouraging attacks.11This work was funded in part by the Office of Naval Research under the OSD Minerva program: Grant number N00014-17-1-2423.

Determining correlation and causation will be difficult due to the hidden nature of cyber attacks, the veiled motivations of differing actors, and other factors. However even if causation may never be clear, changes in the direction and magnitude of cyber attacks can be suggestive of the success or failure of these new policies, especially as their proponents suggest they should be especially effective.

This chapter reviews debates about the definition of cyber operations and cyber deterrence, distinguishing the use of cyberspace to support deterrence in other domains and the deterrence of actions in cyberspace itself. The author finds that uncertainty is a resounding theme in this literature, which poses both challenges and opportunities for cross-domain deterrence.

For a system of cross-domain deterrence to work, actors must understand what actions will trigger a response, what the response is likely to be, and how willing the respondent is to act. Any such system is likely to be less robust than Cold War nuclear deterrence because of the number of domains involved, constraints on revealing secret capabilities or even the identity of the challenger, and a propensity for provocations that fall below the established threshold of response. This chapter recommends using an analogy to the law of war rather than to nuclear deterrence to understand the possibilities of setting up a workable regime of cross-domain deterrence, even as the author is pessimistic about the ability of any collective regime to adequately manage the complexity of cross-domain deterrence.",Cross-Domain Deterrence,2019,,,187-204,"Morrow, James D.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1118068090,0,

They built a grassroots movement that transcended the traditional Cold War divisions and ignored political warnings about the need for nuclear deterrence against the communist threat. Clean soil, clean air, and clean food, as well as the health of current and future generations of children, were at stake, making the cost of defense against an abstract communist enemy too high a price to pay for many.

Situating the security domain alongside economic and social domains of interaction among countries is important for creating a full analysis of a state’s priorities in a particular region, or with any particular other state. Failure to appreciate the nonmilitary dimensions of international relations in Asia in particular can lead one to misdiagnose the prospects of conflict and cooperation, potentially leading to tragic spirals. Data on East Asian defense spending over twenty-five years appears to present a puzzle: by many measures, East Asian military expenditures have declined significantly over the past quarter century. This finding appears starkly at odds with the conventional wisdom that Chinese bellicosity, its expenditure on anti-access/area-denial capabilities, and the United States’ reallocation of forces are increasing tensions in the region.

Antisatellite technology was deployed, but it was also immature. Today, the broader use of space for conventional power projection, together with more mature target discrimination and antisatellite technology, create strong incentives for both the United States and its adversaries to conduct counter-space operations. The United States’ military power projection is utterly dependent on space assets for command, control, communications, intelligence, and targeting, but satellites are increasingly vulnerable to antisatellite capabilities, including not only direct attacks on satellites but also indirect cyber and electronic warfare interference on satellites, links, and ground-based control infrastructure. Several cross-domain options are available for deterrence both by denial (the threat of effective defense) and by punishment (the threat of retaliation).

It shows that, while local authorities, individuals and extra-parliamentary groups certainly dreaded the prospect of nuclear war, the nuclear weapons issue often presented them with a vehicle to protest against British government policy more broadly.",Contemporary British History,2019,33,2,1-20,"Laucht, Christoph; Johnes, Martin",Swansea University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107348576,4,"[Nehring, Holger; Ziemann, Benjamin]|[ur.016026326541.11; ur.015212312727.56]||2012|12|1|1-24|10.1080/14682745.2011.625160|pub.1011664846|6;[Jamison, Brian P.]|[]|Contemporary British History|2007|21|4|449-469|10.1080/13619460601060454|pub.1014113778|3;[Whitham, Charlie]|[]|The Welsh History Review / Cylchgrawn Hanes Cymru|2009|24|4|168-186|10.16922/whr.24.4.6|pub.1016770690|2;[FARISH, MATTHEW; MONTEYNE, DAVID]|[ur.0615405762.85; ur.012525357667.93]|Urban History|2015|42|4|543-546|10.1017/s0963926815000607|pub.1018313324|6;[Lansley, Stewart; Goss, Sue; Wolmar, Christian]|[; ; ]||1989||||10.1007/978-1-349-20231-7|pub.1044857820|90;[Titcombe, Elaine]|[]|Women's History Review|2013|22|2|310-329|10.1080/09612025.2012.726118|pub.1047085729|4;[SCHREGEL, SUSANNE]|[ur.01367276161.11]|Urban History|2015|42|4|564-583|10.1017/s0963926815000565|pub.1053843174|5;[Nehring, H.]|[]|The English Historical Review|2012|127|527|920-949|10.1093/ehr/ces176|pub.1059546864|10;[Burkett, Jodi]|[ur.015631170171.30]|Twentieth Century British History|2010|21|2|184-205|10.1093/tcbh/hwp057|pub.1060052941|9;[Stafford, James]|[]|Twentieth Century British History|2012|23|3|383-407|10.1093/tcbh/hwr034|pub.1060053041|9;[Payling, D.]|[]|Twentieth Century British History|2014|25|4|602-627|10.1093/tcbh/hwu001|pub.1060053167|14;[Hill, Christopher R.]|[]|Twentieth Century British History|2016|27|1|26-50|10.1093/tcbh/hwv033|pub.1060053264|4;[Sabin, Philip A.

Across that period, the policies that governed civil defence were also reformed to support the development of Britain’s nuclear deterrent. In that context, an imagined nuclear war gradually came to inform defence strategies that sought to deter, rather than prepare for, armed conflict. The nuclear deterrent determined a new era of security in which the original purpose of civil defence was increasingly viewed as redundant in official and everyday opinion. By the mid-1960s, nuclear deterrence was an accepted tool of Cold War peace and CDC was discontinued. This article uses the original oral history testimonies of civil defence volunteers to investigate experiences of nuclear war according to people engaged directly in official projections of war. The article engages with scholarship on the imagined and discursive Cold War to argue that recruits experienced nuclear training through personal conceptualisation processes extending far beyond official versions of nuclear attack. The article argues that oral history narratives provide an unrivalled source through which to profile the fragile and ambiguous interior processes that underpinned official and unofficial interpretations of nuclear security at the time.",Contemporary British History,2019,33,2,1-21,"Douthwaite, Jessica",University of Strathclyde,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107346461,1,"[Abrams, Lynn]|[]|Social History|2014|39|1|14-35|10.1080/03071022.2013.872904|pub.1000783752|10;[Eustace, Nicole;

The article supposes the main reason for making the strategy is the US’ desire to preserve her hegemony over the rise of China. The strategy consists of five main moves: economic restraint, technology restraint, restraint of territorial sovereignty ambition, assault on soft power, military deterrence, and prevention of coalition alliances. These moves will make the US-China relationship increasingly tense. However, except for the excess of the limit of restraining territorial sovereignty ambition, especially related to Taiwan, the other moves may make the US-China relations tense, but will not drive these two countries to war.",VNU Journal of Foreign Studies,2019,35,2,,"Anh, Nguyen Ngoc",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114089266,0,

Taylor deftly handled Cold War crises, helped build alliance relationships, linked politics, economics, diplomacy, and military affairs, and worked at the intersection of operational command and strategic planning. He and the army also coped with strategy shifts as the Truman administration endorsed a buildup of conventional and nuclear forces and President Eisenhower returned to nuclear deterrence and emphasis on the air force. In 1955, Taylor drafted a plan for a strategy of flexible response that combined nuclear and conventional armaments.

This chapter argues that the traditional theorization of escalation dynamics in South Asia does not expect the possibility of: i) autonomous military factors triggering severe ceasefire violations (CFVs); ii) CFVs triggering escalation, and; iii) accidental/inadvertent escalation to some extent. The absence of such expectations further cements the strongly held belief that escalation is controllable especially due to the existence of a general context of nuclear deterrence-induced stability. The chapter, besides highlighting the theoretical finding of the book, also discusses various measures that can be taken to control CFVs and India–Pakistan crisis escalation.",Line on Fire,2019,,,290-312,"Jacob, Happymon",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115223878,0,

pub.1112215200,10.1093/ia/iiz002,‘Peace through strength’: Europe and NATO deterrence beyond the US Nuclear Posture Review,"Abstract With its 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, the Trump administration expanded the scope of US nuclear deterrence, re-emphasizing the importance of non-strategic nuclear weapons, perceptively lowering the threshold for nuclear use and casting doubt on the future of arms control. The authors argue that these changes are consistent with the administration's wider ‘peace through strength’ approach that draws on traditional Republican thinking on security policy. While designed to demonstrate credibility and resolve to both allies and adversaries, however, this assertive approach to security policy and specifically nuclear policy as a necessary precursor to renewed engagement in strategic negotiations may have unintended consequences. This article focuses on European reactions to the strategy and argues that the Trump administration's nuclear posture challenges common European understandings in three principal areas. First, changes to US declaratory policy contest European assumptions on the role of nuclear weapons in defending NATO. Second, US modernization plans and their implications for intra-alliance relations risk accentuating controversial debates about the US commitment to Europe. Third, the apparent US rejection of arms control widens the scope for discord with European leaders. If European leaders assert a clear and credible alternative vision advocating nuclear restraint, risk reduction and arms control they could rebuild trust and confidence between the United States, NATO and Russia, demonstrating real strength and ultimately leading to more genuine opportunities for peace and sustainable European security.",International Affairs,2019,95,2,iiz002-,"McCrisken, Trevor; Downman, Maxwell",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112215200,0,

Eine strategische Vision transatlantischer Macht,"AbstractThe coming end of Merkel’s tenure in power provides an opening for strategic thinking. Observing an interregnum in world politics, China needs to be regarded as America’s most significant great power rival by the latter’s NATO partners. As the possibility of a war between China and America cannot be ruled out, US capabilities, conventional and nuclear, may be stretched. Thus, America could well reach for a rapprochement with Russia to weaken China.

pub.1126736166,10.30907/jj.v0i55.13,"Article The problem of nuclear proliferation and its impact on the formula of strategic balance in the Middle East after the events of September 11, 2001","The issue of nuclear proliferation is one of the most vital issues as it reflects a form of dealing in the field of international relations. Therefore, the Middle East region has taken great interest in reducing the levels of nuclear armament and acquiring nuclear power within the strategic framework of the international and regional powers. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East region is currently one of the most important international and regional arrangements for controlling the levels of nuclear proliferation and attempting to build a state of stability and balance. In the Middle East and the world. The importance of the research comes from the fact that it deals with an important and vital issue: the issue of nuclear proliferation and its implications for the equation of the strategic balance in the Middle East after the events of September 11, 2001, which gained great importance in the post-cold war era. And to achieve some kind of stability and balance within the framework of the international and regional environment, especially in the Middle East, which has increased the importance of efforts in this regard the proliferation of nuclear weapons to new countries, it is possible to obtain nuclear technology by enhancing levels The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has become one of the most important facts for the post-Cold War era. At a time when only five countries possessed nuclear weapons (the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain) , As well as the possibility of other countries such as India, Pakistan and Israel, which suggests that the post-Cold War era has seen a widening of the circle of States possessing or manufacturing such weapons (Pakistan, North Korea and Iran) The emergence of regional tensions as in the case of William Middle East. Thus, the issue of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has become a central issue in the context of the post-Cold War American strategy, especially after the events of September 11, 2001, as a result of the convictions that there is an interrelationship between the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the global fight against terrorism. In keeping with this, the research started from the premise that the continuity of the Middle East countries in seeking to acquire nuclear capabilities is in itself an essential brake or determinant of the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, as well as the lack of guarantees to establish security among countries The Middle East, which is reflected negatively on the regional and international security approaches to the Middle East, and of course lead to the adoption of their respective security policies against each other within the framework of the growing levels of nuclear weapons to achieve some kind of balance towards the nuclear capabilities of each of these countries And then more nuclear armament policies in the region, as a result can not promote positive security perceptions that are based on the employment of enablers of smart power, which is reflected negatively on the strategic balance in the territory of the Middle East equation.

pub.1099656275,10.1057/s41311-017-0117-x,The nationalist interpretation of nuclear deterrence: evidence from the Kargil War,"Why did Pakistan initiate the Kargil War with India, so soon after the two states reached overt nuclear status? Existing theories attribute war between nuclear states either to the strategic opportunities of limited conflict or to a closing opportunity of preventive war to destroy the nuclear capabilities of nuclearizing states. However, strategic opportunities explain the possibility of, but not the motivation for, war; after all, the nuclearization of India began long before the war. To develop a better explanation, I propose an original theory of how the theoretical mechanisms of nuclear deterrence can be altered by nationalist conflict. The Indo-Pakistani nationalist conflict not only motivated Pakistan to initiate the war because of its perception of a threat, but also caused both states to overestimate their own deterrence credibility and underestimate the other’s capability and resolve to conduct war. These nationalist motivations and estimations enabled the war between the two nuclear states.

pub.1107982777,10.1016/j.spacepol.2018.10.003,Space deterrence: In search of a ‘magical formula’,"The development of antisatellite (ASAT) weapons is a crucial process of the second era of space militarisation. As a result, outer space loses the status of a sanctuary. However, this process does not steam only from the technological advance but rather from strategic circumstances. The increasing number of space actors makes the system less stable. The degree of dependency on space assets is significantly different in different countries, which creates the vulnerability gap. What is more, the capability to defend a space infrastructure is profoundly limited because of physical and technological limitations, favouring offensive actions. Outer space is turning into offense-dominant domain. The growing risk of using ASAT weapons and the paramount importance of satellites in supporting armed forces prompt a search for protecting space infrastructure. Therefore, the space deterrence seems to be an attractive tool for increasing the security of space assets. So far, this branch of deterrence has been in the margins of strategic studies, as the possibilities of undertaking action against space assets were very limited. The aim of the article was to analyse the adequacy of the development of the space deterrence concept, with respect to strategic and technological circumstances and to compare it to nuclear deterrence as being one of the most examined deterrence concepts. The starting point for the analysis is the general characteristics of deterrence concept with special regard to nuclear deterrence as an example of its effective application (even though, the capability to generate deterrent effect is still in dispute). The article subsequently examines the reasons making the space deterrence a current and important issue—the end of sanctuary and the creation of new battlefield in outer space, resulting from the pursuit of operational deployment of ASAT weapons. The strategic consideration is taken into account, including asymmetric dependence on space assets and, consequently, unfavourable to US military benefit–risk balance of space warfare. The difficulties in protecting the space infrastructure, favouring offensive action, are examined. The comparison between nuclear and space deterrence indicated 2 key differences—the lack of existential threat and retaliation credibility characterises space deterrence. Based on these theoretical frameworks, the sample of escalation ladder in space is proposed. It should be stressed that the ladder refers only to the attack on space infrastructure (and the attack from space at the top of the ladder).

First, it corresponds with the real politik vision of world politics where the states engage in (zero-sum) competition for power and resources. Second, the new world order emerges because of a conflict between different models of development and value systems. These two observations highlight a certain “family resemblance” between the current Russian assessment of the current security environment and the situation during the Cold War. Furthermore, Russian national security strategy is oriented toward achieving strategic stability with the other great powers. The maintenance of strategic parity (nuclear and conventional deterrence) is a means to this end. However, given Russia’s relative weakness in comparison to its major geopolitical competitors, this has led to the renewal of the Cold War-era concept of asymmetric approach. Although this concept is most often used in the context of nuclear deterrence and the debate on “strategic stability,” it is not about military security only. The set of asymmetric measures from economic dependence or sanctions, to diplomatic, political, and informational measures are used to prevent an emergence of a conflict that would threaten Russia’s sovereignty and domestic stability. The purpose of this paper is to explore the Soviet roots of Active Measures and how the Soviet heritage is present at both the theoretical level and in concrete practices.

Unlike in the Cold War era, the international society has become more interconnected, and each country’s economy is dependent on that of other countries. Destroying another nation through war is now the equivalent of destroying part of one’s own economic foundation. The current concern, therefore, is not the physical destruction of the world due to nuclear retaliation by the United States or China, but rather “mutually assured economic destruction” in which the global economy becomes dysfunctional. However, even if it is now apparent that a war option is not viable, Japan still sticks to US extended nuclear deterrence. The author examines why and how disadvantageous it is for Japan to continue to rely on nuclear deterrence to defend against the threat of North Korea. If it is possible to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear program through negotiation and giving incentives, it would demonstrate that an approach other than deterrence could be successful.",Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament,2019,2,1,357-369,"Yanagisawa, Kyoji",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112942555,1,

After non-conventional and conventional military buildups in the past, an arms race in the domain of outer space is now a possibility. Space is an advantageous frontier for military uses. In this context, the consensus in international law defines space as a global commons to be used for peaceful purposes. Nonetheless, space powers, including India, engage in space militarization, which can lead to the weaponization of space. India is motivated in this regard by aspirations of regional hegemony and to balance its capabilities with respect to China in an effort to counter China’s increasing influence in South Asia. These developments posit adverse effects on the strategic equation in South Asia, leading to strategic instability, and can undermine nuclear deterrence and bring about a South Asian arms race in space. Moreover, the security dilemma in South Asia has prompted defensive and offensive reactions from rival states in the region, exacerbating repercussions on the South Asian strategic landscape.

pub.1129456303,10.1093/cybsec/tyz007,"Escalation firebreaks in the cyber, conventional, and nuclear domains: moving beyond effects-based logics","Abstract Despite the growing literature on cyber security, most studies have sidestepped important questions of how conflict escalates in the cyber domain. To better understand this dynamic, we advance two main theoretical pathways of escalation, one in which actors respond with increasing intensity based on the effect of an attack, irrespective of how it is conducted (through cyber, conventional, or nuclear) and another in which the means of attack determines the actor’s willingness to escalate. We then test those effects- and means-based pathways with an original experiment that probes support for escalation, focusing on the American public, a key actor in debates about nuclear escalation and deterrence. Our study suggests that cyberattacks create a threshold that restrains the escalation of conflict. Americans are less likely to support retaliation with force when the scenario involves a cyberattack even when they perceive the magnitude of attacks across domains to be comparable. Our findings provide support for cyber strategies based on assumptions of cyber thresholds, while also casting doubt on the credibility of cyber deterrence by punishment.

pub.1122454984,10.1093/cybsec/tyz008,The implications of persistent (and permanent) engagement in cyberspace,"Abstract                   The USA is in the midst of its most resounding policy shift on cyber conflict with profound implications for national security and the future of the Internet. The US Department of Defense (DoD) cyber strategy concludes that since US cyber forces are in “persistent engagement” with adversaries, then it is an imperative for them to “defend forward” to “continuously contest” them. The implicit prediction is that adversaries will become less effective, forced to expend more resources on defense and rebuild capabilities and infrastructure. John Bolton, the national security advisor, has boasted of a new policy to use offensive cyber operations to impose costs on adversaries and create the frameworks of deterrence. Over time, proponents suggest, these policies will be stabilizing as adversaries engage over repeated engagements in “tacit bargaining” of what is and is not acceptable leading to “more stable expectations of acceptable and unacceptable behavior”. This article advances existing research by including a deeper discussion the academic and policy background on active defense and cyber deterrence, discussing the implied causal chain of “persistent- engagement stability theory,” and analyzing potential risks, especially specific feedback loops which may amplify or dampen cyber conflict. It concludes with specific policy solutions to help mitigate these risks and a suggestion for a broader theory, “stability-enhancing engagement theory.”",Journal of Cybersecurity,2019,5,1,,"Healey, Jason",Columbia University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122454984,7,"[McDermott, Rose]|[ur.0647245764.38]|Perspectives on Politics|2004|2|4|691-706|10.1017/s1537592704040459|pub.1023402633|184;[Gartzke, Erik; Lindsay, Jon R.]|[ur.014753037012.98; ur.016123225213.98]|Security Studies|2015|24|2|316-348|10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188|pub.1052004488|40;[Elliott, David]|[]|IEEE Security & Privacy|2011|9|5|36-40|10.1109/msp.2011.24|pub.1061423597|11;[Nye, Joseph S.]|[]|International Security|2017|41|3|44-71|10.1162/isec_a_00266|pub.1083410445|52;[Fischerkeller, Michael P.; Harknett, Richard J.]|[; ]|Orbis|2017|61|3|381-393|10.1016/j.orbis.2017.05.003|pub.1085607496|8;[Harknett, Richard J.; Nye, Joseph S.]|[; ]|International Security|2017|42|2|196-199|10.1162/isec_c_00290|pub.1092477218|3;[Jervis, Robert]|[]||1998||||10.1515/9781400822409|pub.1096908874|88"

The central objective is to understand United Kingdom’s role in Europe’s security in these domains and the consequences associated with Brexit. The chapter firstly traces the origins and the historical evolution of European security policies on nuclear weapons and its significant impact on security and defence matters. Secondly, it examines the state of play of Europe’s strategies and policies on nuclear deterrence and cooperation, respectively. And thirdly, it discusses the challenges posed to the EU and the UK on security and defence cooperation. The analysis applies a comparative methodology and draws on primary documentary data gathered by the author during research in the Historical Archives of the European Union, Florence, and on expert interviews.","Peace, Security and Defence Cooperation in Post-Brexit Europe",2019,,,163-190,"Vicente, Adérito",European University Institute,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112905539,0,"[Harries, Matthew]|[]|Survival|2012|54|1|7-30|10.1080/00396338.2012.657528|pub.1005443962|4;[SMETANA, MICHAL]|[ur.010420227425.53]|International Affairs|2016|92|1|137-152|10.1111/1468-2346.12510|pub.1006994809|9;[Jasper, Ursula; Portela, Clara]|[ur.01073471477.39; ]|Security Dialogue|2010|41|2|145-168|10.1177/0967010610361889|pub.1010939602|8;[Kienzle, Benjamin]|[ur.015323703013.32]|EU Policy Responses to a Shifting Multilateral System|2016|||25-48|10.1057/978-1-137-54758-3_2|pub.1012262820|1;[Snyder, Glenn Herald]|[]||1961||||10.1515/9781400877164|pub.1018970969|179;[Brodie, Bernard]|[]||1959||||10.1515/9781400875108|pub.1028600531|198;[]|[]||2015||||10.1057/9781137378446|pub.1032094188|1;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]||2003||||10.1057/9780230379435|pub.1035730468|74;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[ur.014521466007.50; ur.012753062546.31]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2012|68|5|96-104|10.1177/0096340212459040|pub.1038955368|11;[Huth, Paul K.]|[ur.016301126663.22]|Annual Review of Political Science|1999|2|1|25-48|10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.25|pub.1042694520|72;[Gavin, Francis J.]|[ur.012732073475.73]|International Security|2015|40|1|9-46|10.1162/isec_a_00205|pub.1051630812|29;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1978|30|2|167-214|10.2307/2009958|pub.1051767591|949;[Huth, Paul K.]|[ur.016301126663.22]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1990|34|2|270-290|10.1177/0022002790034002005|pub.1063626354|36;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[ur.014521466007.50; ur.012753062546.31]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2017|73|5|1-9|10.1080/00963402.2017.1363995|pub.1091457192|7;[Sharp, Jane M.

How can artificial intelligence help to handle this challenge? What is a heuristic path that can quickly lead to accurate attribution? These are the questions that need to be addressed. Existing heuristic algorithms have issues in supporting both accuracy and speed simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel heuristic approach that is empowered by intelligent hints and intelligence collection. With the help of the weighted system, this new heuristic approach is able to determine the priority in search of the missing attributes, thus successfully providing a path towards fast and accurate attribution.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,2019,857,,1072-1082,"Chen, Jim Q.",National Defense University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107966390,1,"[Martí, Rafael; Reinelt, Gerhard]|[ur.016610127735.00; ur.01333750375.41]|Applied Mathematical Sciences|2011|175|||10.1007/978-3-642-16729-4|pub.1001961306|103;[Beebe, Nicole]|[ur.014521316625.04]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2009|306||17-36|10.1007/978-3-642-04155-6_2|pub.1027119174|81;[Dechter, Rina; Pearl, Judea]|[ur.0736627660.65; ur.01360103132.74]|Journal of the ACM|1985|32|3|505-536|10.1145/3828.3830|pub.1048676155|521;[Corana, A.; Marchesi, M.; Martini, C.; Ridella, S.]|[ur.011625741343.51; ur.013262640643.74; ur.01104676035.90; ur.01274007147.59]|ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software|1987|13|3|262-280|10.1145/29380.29864|pub.1052942382|1100;[Chen, Jim Q.]|[ur.015760673057.00]|2016 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI)|2016|||701-704|10.1109/wi.2016.0125|pub.1095537780|3;[Chen, Jim Q.]|[]|2017 International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon U.S.)|2017|||29-35|10.1109/cyconus.2017.8167510|pub.1099651980|1"

The author considers four questions: How did the Treaty come to include a prohibition on threatened use? What does the prohibition mean for threatened self-defensive use of nuclear weapons under jus ad bellum? Does the prohibition cover nuclear deterrence? Does threatening to use nuclear weapons include threatening to have these weapons used on one’s behalf by its nuclear-armed ally?

The decision to create the missile base in this French heartland was taken by the Gaullist power in Paris in 1965, without considering local expectations. This arouse strong national and local conflicts, both political and cultural, in the 1960’s, between supporters of the militarization and its opponents. Nuclear missiles were not welcome by all: anxiety and new popular culturesuch as rumours about UFO’stestify for the entering in a new age. Was there a real patriotic consent to cold war? Resignation and fatalistic attitudes seem to have prevailed. Since the late 2000’s, i.e. twenty years after the demilitarization of Albion, some former servicemen still denounce the activities linked to nuclear missiles as responsible for radioactive contamination and persistent diseases.

Although there have been fundamental changes in international relations and the security environment, efforts and initiatives in the field have proved to be often free from obstacles and disagreements. One reason for this is due to the increase in the number of states involved in the negotiations and, implicitly, the multiplication of political, economic and security interests. The logic of the bipolar world and nuclear deterrence, characteristic of the Cold War, did not take into account the security aspirations of other state actors. Currently, nuclear weapons, although necessitating an internationally sustained dialogue, raise issues that make it difficult to cooperate in this area. Owners cannot be subjected to collective sanction. Theoretically, they have great freedom of action, which can ultimately be restrained only by other nuclear powers.

Forfatterne argumenterer for at det er essensielt å opprette og ansvarliggjøre en multinasjonal og multidepartemental/-sektoriell cyberorganisasjon for at reel cyber-avskrekking skal være mulig å generere. Innledningsvis beskriver artikkelen den klassiske og utvidede oppfatningen av avskrekking, og hvilke kriterier som må ligge til grunn for å kunne oppnå avskrekkende effekt; kapasitet, kredibilitet, og evnen til å kommunisere effektivt. Sett fra et globalt sikkerhetsperspektiv har muligheten til å generere avskrekkende effekt vært med på å forme verden i perioden 1945 til 1990. Kompleksiteten i sikkerhetssektoren har imidlertid økt signifikant siden da, mye grunnet økt global konnektivitet og fremveksten av cyberdomenet. Artikkelen diskuterer hvordan kriteriene for avskrekking utfordres når strategien skal appliseres i cyberdomenet, med fokus på problemene knyttet til antallet aktører/vektorer, ulike motiver for handlinger, manglende felles grunnlag som utgangspunkt for å adressere utfordringene, og forskjellig oppfatning omkring attribusjon og proporsjonalitetsprinsippet. Forfatterne fremholder at disse utfordringene gjør det vanskeligere, men desto viktigere å identifisere hvordan man kan generere avskrekking i cyberdomenet – spesielt for høyteknologiske småstater, som Norge. Å håndtere dette på en god måte forutsetter at man ser på bredden av avskrekkingsteori i sammenheng over tid, og småstater må erkjenne sine svakheter og spille på sine styrker. Anbefalingene som fremlegges er åpningstrekk som gjør nettopp dette, og som samtidig bereder grunnen for å dra veksler på komplementære effekter av ulike dimensjoner ved avskrekkingststrategi på lenger sikt. --------------------------- Abstract (english): This article explores the possibilities and challenges associated with deterrence as strategy in the increasingly significant cyber-domain, from a small state perspective. The authors argue that genuine cyber-deterrence is contingent upon the creation of an accountable cyberorganization, with a multinational and multi-departmental/sectorial composition. The article addresses classical and broader deterrence, and the criterions that must be met in order to successfully deter; capability, credibility, and the ability to communicate effectively. From a global perspective, the ability to generate effective deterrence has been key to shape the international security landscape in the period from 1945 to 1990. However, the complexity of the security sector has increased significantly since then – much due to the seemingly ever-growing global connectedness and the emergence of the cyber-domain. The article further explores and discusses how the criteria for effective deterrence is tested when applied to the cyber-domain, with emphasis in the problems associated with the number of actors/vectors, varying motives for actions, the lack of a shared conceptual foundation as a basis to address the challenges, and differing opinions concerning attribution and proportionality. The authors argue that these problems make it difficult, but thus the more important to identify how to generate effective deterrence in the cyber-domain – especially for high-tech small states such as Norway. Effective management of the problem-complex requires exploration of the whole range of deterrence theory over time, and small states must recognize their inherent weaknesses and play to their strengths. The recommendation put forth here is an initial move which allows just that, and which at the same time sets the stage for more elaborate strategies that exploit the complementary effects of different dimensions of-, and approaches to deterrence.",Internasjonal Politikk,2019,77,3,252-265,"Kristiansen, Marius; Hoem, Njål",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121225021,0,

Drawing from recent findings in the life sciences, this article offers a cultural neuroscience approach to deterrence decision-making, with special attention given to the ways in which culture interacts with cognition and the security environment to shape behavioral outcomes during conflict. Since North Korea remains largely a ""black box"" in international relations, a cultural neuroscience perspective can provide valuable insight into the effects of cultural conditioning on perception and cognition within the context of nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula. Through an analysis of the bureaucratic and military structures, leadership characteristics, and institutional landscapes shaping North Korean strategic culture, this article examines the influences of historical memory and cultural values, such as collectivism, honor, and face-saving, on political decision-making in Pyongyang.",Politics and the Life Sciences,2018,37,2,156-179,"Friend, John M",University of Hawaii at Manoa,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115171866,0,

É uma região na qual predominam atores cujas ações possuem alcance global, mesmo quando se trata da Coreia do Norte, o país mais pobre da região. Além da Coreia do Norte, as interações entre China, Rússia, Japão, Coreia do Sul, e Estados Unidos como potência extrarregional com presença militar na região, afetam a distribuição de poder no Sistema Internacional. A consolidação da China como Grande Potência reconfigurou a região e tem evidenciado o papel crucial que esse subsistema regional exerce para a polaridade no século XXI. Nos últimos anos, a consolidação do programa nuclear norte-coreano, a ascensão de Xi Jinping na China, a busca por reafirmação japonesa, a chegada de Donald Trump ao poder, reorientam as relações regionais. O presente artigo procura discutir as transformações na ordem regional no Nordeste Asiático desde o final da Guerra Fria até seus desdobramentos recentes e seus efeitos sobre as disputas hegemônicas. Assim, avaliam-se os processos que vêm ampliando a tendência à militarização e competição na região e o papel que a dissuasão nuclear exerce como fator determinante para o balanço regional.     Abstract: The region of Northeast Asia stands out for its geopolitical singularity. It is a region dominated by actors whose actions are global in scope, even when it comes to North Korea, the region's poorest country. In addition to North Korea, interactions between China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and the United States as an extra-regional power with military presence in the region affect the distribution of power in the International System. The consolidation of China as a Great Power has reconfigured the region and has highlighted the crucial role that this regional subsystem plays in polarity in the twenty-first century. In recent years, the consolidation of North Korea's nuclear program, the rise of Xi Jinping in China, the search for Japanese reaffirmation, reorient regional relations. This article discusses the transformations in the regional order in Northeast Asia from the end of the Cold War until its recent unfolding and its effects on the hegemonic disputes. Thus, are evaluated the processes that have been increasing the tendency towards militarization and competition in the region and the role that nuclear deterrence plays as a determining factor for the regional balance. Keywords: Northeast Asia; Hegemonic Recomposition; Regionalism.     Recebido em: Agosto/2018. Aprovado em: Dezembro/2018.",Brazilian Journal of International Relations,2018,7,3,611-644,"Brites, Pedro Vinícius Pereira",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122112292,0,

It first provides an overview of three main approaches to the study of culture and strategy, paying attention to political culture as well as the relationship between strategic culture and nuclear deterrence. It then examines various sources of strategic culture identified in the literature, along with theoretical issues related to strategic culture. In particular, it explores the link between constructivism and strategic culture, the question of continuity in state behaviour and how strategic cultural dilemmas can cause changes in security policy, and the ‘keepers’ of strategic culture. The chapter also asks whether non-state, state, and multistate actors can possess distinctive strategic cultures before concluding with an analysis of the role of strategic culture in the acquisition of — and threats to use — weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).",Strategy in the Contemporary World,2018,,,89-107,"Lantis, Jeffrey S.; Howlett, Darryl",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130192499,0,
pub.1092106702,10.1177/0263395717733978,Democracy versus deterrence: Nuclear weapons and political integrity,"This article argues that the practice and performance of nuclear deterrence can never be fully representative or democratic due to the particular pressures placed on leaders by the nuclear condition. For nuclear deterrence to be effective – and for nuclear weapons to have any political value – a leader must always convince both their electorate as well as any possible foe, that they are willing to use nuclear weapons in extremis, irrespective of whether this is their true position. In any nuclear-armed state, where politicians privately believe that using nuclear weapons is always wrong, but publicly stress that possessing nuclear weapons to use as a deterrent is right, they are forced to act dishonestly. These tensions are particularly acute in the UK context given the reliance on just one form of nuclear weapons system for deterrence and the concurrent requirement to pre-delegate secret orders through a ‘letter of last resort’. The consequences for democratic nuclear-armed states are troubling; for public morality, the personal integrity of democratic leaders, and for true democratic accountability. This article concludes that public criticism of political leaders, and citizen voting choices, ought to take account of the problem of transparency posed by policies of nuclear deterrence.",Australian Journal of Political Science,2018,38,4,500-513,"Cooke, Steve; Futter, Andrew",University of Leicester,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092106702,0,"[Strohminger, Nina; Nichols, Shaun]|[ur.01101400567.02; ur.01122143612.89]|Cognition|2014|131|1|159-171|10.1016/j.cognition.2013.12.005|pub.1013553662|208;[Edyvane, Derek]|[ur.015461777461.09]|Journal of Applied Philosophy|2015|32|3|310-325|10.1111/japp.12100|pub.1016787408|2;[Heiphetz, Larisa; Strohminger, Nina; Young, Liane L.]|[ur.0724314057.91; ur.01101400567.02; ur.0647541736.87]|Cognitive Science|2017|41|3|744-767|10.1111/cogs.12354|pub.1019281219|33;[Williams, Bernard]|[]|Public and Private Morality|1978|||55-74|10.1017/cbo9780511625329.004|pub.1022171452|48;[De Wijze, Stephen]|[ur.016570743751.79]|Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|2005|7|5|453-471|10.1007/s10677-005-6836-x|pub.1030689019|28;[Hampshire, Stuart]|[]|Public and Private Morality|1978|||23-54|10.1017/cbo9780511625329.003|pub.1038123355|34;[Christiano, Thomas]|[]|Journal of Political Philosophy|2004|12|3|266-290|10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00200.x|pub.1043704755|95;[THOMPSON, DENNIS F.]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|1999|114|2|181-193|10.2307/2657736|pub.1047127591|63;[Lenard, Patti Tamara]|[ur.014571523427.70]|The Monist|2015|98|4|353-359|10.1093/monist/onv017|pub.1059924302|5;[de Wijze, Stephen]|[]|Philosophy in the Contemporary World|2003|10|1|37-42|10.5840/pcw20031014|pub.1073224237|3;[Galston, William]|[]|Social Theory and Practice|1991|17|2|175-197|10.5840/soctheorpract19911724|pub.1073251283|6;[Williams, Bernard]|[]||1995||||10.1017/cbo9780511621246|pub.1098665791|504;[Baylis, John; Stoddart, Kristan]|[ur.014741310037.95; ur.011224140637.88]||2014||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198702023.001.0001|pub.1098750255|7"
pub.1107909173,10.3389/fmars.2018.00403,Behavior Change Interventions to Reduce Illegal Fishing,"Illegal fishing is a serious problem that threatens the sustainability of fisheries around the world. Policy makers and fishery managers often rely on the imposition of strict sanctions and relatively intensive monitoring and enforcement programs to increase the costs of illegal behavior and thus deter it. However, while this can be successful in fisheries with sufficient resources to support high levels of surveillance and effective systems for imposing penalties, many fisheries lack the resources and requisite governance to successfully deter illegal fishing. Other types of governance systems, such as customary marine tenure and co-management, rely more on mechanisms such as norms, trust, and the perceived legitimacy of regulations for compliance. More generally, the absence of such social and psychological factors that encourage compliance in any fishery can undermine the efficacy of an otherwise effective and well-designed fishery management system. Here we describe insights from behavioral science that may be helpful in augmenting and securing the effectiveness of conventional deterrence strategies as well as in developing alternative means of deterring illegal fishing in fisheries in which high levels of surveillance and enforcement are not feasible. We draw on the behavioral science literature to describe a process for designing interventions for changing specific illegal fishing behaviors. The process begins with stakeholder characterization to capture existing norms, beliefs, and modes of thinking about illegal fishing as well as descriptions of specific illegal fishing behaviors. Potential interventions that may disrupt the beliefs, norms, and thought modes that give rise to these behaviors, along with those that encourage desirable behaviors, can be developed by applying principles gleaned from the behavioral science literature. These potential interventions can then be tested in artefactual experiments, piloted with small groups of actual stakeholders and, finally, implemented at scale.",Frontiers in Marine Science,2018,5,,403,"Battista, Willow; Romero-Canyas, Rainer; Smith, Sarah Lindley; Fraire, Jose; Effron, Micah; Larson-Konar, Dylan; Fujita, Rod",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107909173,17,"[Day, Brian A.; DeWan, Amielle; Cadiz, Fel Ceasar; Jakosalem-Balane, Joy; Dueñas, Vincent; Trinidad, Pedro M.]|[; ur.01357324045.47; ur.012127452223.40; ur.015115354223.00; ; ]|Applied Environmental Education & Communication|2014|13|1|56-65|10.1080/1533015x.2014.916585|pub.1000292407|3;[Agnew, David J.; Pearce, John; Pramod, Ganapathiraju; Peatman, Tom; Watson, Reg; Beddington, John R.; Pitcher, Tony J.]|[ur.013631757761.38; ur.0656464130.92; ur.01145364004.63; ur.01107141130.52; ur.01035477172.95; ur.015536565265.18; ur.01051042314.92]|PLoS ONE|2009|4|2|e4570|10.1371/journal.pone.0004570|pub.1000632992|455;[Goldstein, Noah J.; Cialdini, Robert B.; Griskevicius, Vladas]|[ur.01056544077.76; ur.01077610647.37; ur.0733350633.41]|Journal of Consumer Research|2008|35|3|472-482|10.1086/586910|pub.1000698743|1437;[Mani, Anandi; Mullainathan, Sendhil; Shafir, Eldar; Zhao, Jiaying]|[ur.01133357136.50; ur.0607166755.44; ur.01307311573.14; ur.016102164027.43]|Science|2013|341|6149|976-980|10.1126/science.1238041|pub.1000928481|867;[Hauck, Maria; Kroese, Marcel]|[ur.01245051637.72; ]|Marine Policy|2006|30|1|74-83|10.1016/j.marpol.2005.06.007|pub.1002468721|89;[van Hoof, Luc]|[]|ICES Journal of Marine Science|2010|67|2|395-401|10.1093/icesjms/fsp239|pub.1002754205|17;[Aboud, Frances E.; Tredoux, Colin; Tropp, Linda R.; Brown, Christia Spears; Niens, Ulrike; Noor, Noraini M.; Group, the Una Global Evaluation]|[ur.01010740471.54; ur.015522245327.14; ur.010070142401.82; ur.01071656201.15; ur.012363521505.54; ur.011711570737.11; ]|Developmental Review|2012|32|4|307-336|10.1016/j.dr.2012.05.001|pub.1003222087|110;[Gupta, Charu]|[ur.011656077647.51]|Cultural Dynamics|2007|19|2-3|237-255|10.1177/0921374007080293|pub.1004574052|11;[Mazar, Nina; Amir, On; Ariely, Dan]|[ur.014405004267.29; ur.012547304004.66; ur.01312451030.82]|Journal of Marketing Research|2008|45|6|633-644|10.1509/jmkr.45.6.633|pub.1006286175|1349;[Kallgren, Carl A.; Reno, Raymond R.; Cialdini, Robert B.]|[ur.015053333153.30; ur.012734707247.64; ur.01077610647.37]|Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|2000|26|8|1002-1012|10.1177/01461672002610009|pub.1006817493|507;[Fehr, Ernst; Gächter, Simon]|[ur.0712117031.12; ur.015056200262.56]|Nature|2002|415|6868|137-140|10.1038/415137a|pub.1007673310|2696;[Weber, Elke U.]|[ur.01307416713.88]|Climatic Change|2006|77|1-2|103-120|10.1007/s10584-006-9060-3|pub.1008002140|531;[Bose, Shekar; Crees-Morris, Adnan]|[ur.011246456253.47; ]|Marine Policy|2009|33|2|248-253|10.1016/j.marpol.2008.07.004|pub.1008377566|15;[Viteri, César; Chávez, Carlos]|[; ur.07557135621.38]|Ocean & Coastal Management|2007|50|3-4|253-274|10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2006.05.002|pub.1008498938|51;[Gutiérrez, Nicolás L.; Hilborn, Ray; Defeo, Omar]|[ur.011527040445.51; ur.01210033332.76; ur.01231547613.98]|Nature|2011|470|7334|386-389|10.1038/nature09689|pub.1008906015|680;[Kahneman, Daniel]|[ur.0103156353.62]|American Psychologist|2003|58|9|697-720|10.1037/0003-066x.58.9.697|pub.1008984423|2635;[Weber, E.U.; Johnson, E.J.; Milch, K.F.; Chang, H.; Brodscholl, J.C.; Goldstein, D.G.]|[ur.01307416713.88; ur.01324023154.96; ur.014475607017.28; ur.015621362047.17; ur.01100574346.48; ur.0723527727.83]|Psychological Science|2007|18|6|516-523|10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01932.x|pub.1009011224|197;[Gifford, Robert]|[ur.0614704543.09]|American Psychologist|2011|66|4|290-302|10.1037/a0023566|pub.1009504259|674;[Gezelius, Stig S.]|[ur.07541453017.18]|Acta Sociologica|2002|45|4|305-314|10.1177/000169930204500404|pub.1010388015|65;[Pramod, Ganapathiraju; Nakamura, Katrina; Pitcher, Tony J.; Delagran, Leslie]|[ur.01145364004.63; ; ur.01051042314.92; ]|Marine Policy|2014|48||102-113|10.1016/j.marpol.2014.03.019|pub.1010638238|109;[Keane, A.; Jones, J.

pub.1107846757,10.16997/book27.q,Thinking the Unthinkable about the Unthinkable – The Use of Nuclear Weapons and the Propaganda Model,"The debate around nuclear weapons in Britain and the US has been long-standing, at times fiercely contested, and almost entirely beside the point. The Chomsky-Herman Propaganda Model of media and scholarly performance predicts that mainstream discussion of foreign and security policy will rigorously observe certain unspoken limits. Key historical events and fundamental principles will be excluded from awareness or discussion. The long debate around ‘nuclear deterrence’ and, as part of that debate, the more recent controversy over the replacement of Britain’s Trident nuclear weapon system has observed these restrictions. There has been no acknowledgement of the history of British nuclear intimidation of non-nuclear weapon states, including Iraq in 1961, 1991 and 2003. There has been no awareness within the mainstream of the implications of this record for the debate around nuclear weapons, or for the definition of ‘nuclear deterrence’.",The Propaganda Model Today: Filtering Perception and Awareness,2018,,,263-277,"Rai, Milan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107846757,0,
pub.1107062916,10.1080/00335630.2018.1519255,"Memes, munitions, and collective copia: The durability of the perpetual peace weapons snowclone","This essay examines the commonplace argument that particular weapons have the power to end war forever. I argue that the basic form of the durable memetic phrasal pattern that emerges from the commonplace’s many iterations is Weapon X makes war impossible. I call this meme the perpetual peace weapons snowclone. Snowclones are formulaic communication patterns that enable users to swap out words, phrases, or images for one another without breaking the original pattern. To understand how and why the perpetual peace weapons snowclone remains cogent for weapons advocacy, I connect Erasmus’s concept of copia to the contemporary concept of snowclones. Taken together, collective copia and snowclones demonstrate how simultaneous linguistic flexibility and rigidity help memes and other rhetorical commonplaces to replicate. I then trace the perpetual peace weapons snowclone’s replication with a historical survey of the oft-repeated commonplace through the development of the atomic bomb, at which point the perpetual peace weapons snowclone transformed into an ideological principle that warranted Cold War nuclear deterrence theory and the Atoms for Peace campaign. The case study demonstrates how, in general, all kinds of commonplaces, memes, clichés, stereotypes, archetypes, and proverbs get reproduced across time and space when collective copia and snowclones interact.",Quarterly Journal of Speech,2018,104,4,1-22,"Hill, Ian E.

pub.1120222988,10.12724/ajss.47.4,India’s Agni Missile Systems: Strengthening India’s Nuclear Deterrence,"Over the years, India has been able to acquire a credible minimum nuclear deterrence. In this, the Agni missile system is integral to India‟s counter second-strike capability especially against China. The Agni category missiles are solid propelled ballistic missiles, ranging from short range missiles to intermediate range missiles (700-5000kms) with road and rail mobility providing greater chances of survivability during an enemy attack. This strengthens its scope of launching a counter/second strike. This makes India one of the few countries in the world with the ability to potentially decapitate its enemy by preserving its arsenal in the first attack from the enemy. This article provides a deep analysis of India‟s Agni missile systems.",Artha - Journal of Social Sciences,2018,17,4,53-69,"Ghoshal, Debalina",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120222988,0,

Despite Russia’s aggressive behaviour, the West’s response to it has been significantly limited, particularly when it comes to non-military deterrence by Continental Europe. The US and the UK are leading the punishment of Russia’s aggression, while many countries, mainly in Western and Southern Europe, are hesitant to respond to this threat.

But it requires an effort to develop a new domain-specific, conceptual, normative, and strategic framework. To be successful, cyber deterrence needs to shift from threatening to prevailing. I argue that by itself, deterrence is insufficient to ensure stability of cyberspace. An international regime of norms regulating state behaviour in cyberspace is necessary to complement cyber deterrence strategies and foster stability. Enforcing this regime requires an authority able to ensure States compliance with the norms at an international level, run investigations into suspected State-run (or Statesponsored) cyber operations to define attribution, expose breaches of the norms, and impose adequate sanctions and punishments. These requirements define a political mandate for an authority that will have a deep impact on international relations and geo-political equilibriums. The UN Security Council has the necessary resources and the political and coercive power to meet these requirements. The time has come to embrace this power to consolidate and enforce an international regime of norms to regulate state behaviour in cyberspace.

pub.1106283373,10.1177/0974928418785479,"A Strategic Essay: Dynamics between a Super President, a Military Alliance and an Intrastate Entity","The emerging dynamics between President Trump, NATO and EU promises to constitute a fascinating new narrative of the changing contours of the international order in this millennium. President Trump has completely reversed American policy towards NATO. As a businessman, Trump has made it clear that henceforth US funding and support would be linked to the US getting a ‘good deal’ from its NATO partners. NATO had earlier anchored itself to the benchmark goal that 2% of a country’s GDP should go to defence spending. President Trump is yet to establish close and friendly relations either with NATO Secretary General or leaders of NATO Member States. Trump’s public embrace of autocratic rulers has caused resentment within NATO. On CSDP the earlier European approach was to lean heavily on the Americans to fund NATO. The friction between the goals of NATO and CSDP increased under the Trump Presidency because of Trump’s insistence on burden sharing of resources and funds among NATO Member States. The CSDP and NATO have overlapping mandates which could be complicated in crisis situations. An independent CSDP remains the core issue causing friction. The U.S. and other non EU weapons producing countries (chiefly Norway and soon the U.K.) also believe that CSDP is manipulating the rules of defence procurement in favour of companies based on EU soil. Is the US justified in attacking CSDP? Many EU Member States believe that protecting European defence industries is a small price to pay for ensuring that a NATO under American leadership not get involved in small regional wars, as an example, in Francophone Africa. Brexit is casting a long shadow. EU and NATO would need to realign themselves from a strategic perspective. NATO and the EU need to prepare for a strategic scenario post Brexit. Following Brexit, 80 percent of NATO defence spending will come from non-EU members. This would shift the onus of decision making within NATO away from the EU. One of the greatest challenges for NATO and the EU is America’s new narrative on Iran and North Korea. EU and NATO are slowly waking up to the new reality that there will be no “business as usual”. If NATO’s military deterrence loses its credibility, this will undermine the credibility of both EU and NATO and endanger international peace and security. What could the EU and NATO do next? Are there any “low hanging fruits” that could be picked in the near future? The EU and NATO understand that there can be no ‘business as usual’. The new global narrative on security would depend on how NATO and EU respond to America’s changed narrative. A timely response is the need of the hour.",India Quarterly A Journal of International Affairs,2018,74,3,290-304,"Mukherjee, Bhaswati",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106283373,0,"[Cohen, Eliot A.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1994|73|1|109|10.2307/20045895|pub.1102758540|43"
pub.1104337755,10.1108/er-04-2017-0085,Explaining and tackling the informal economy: a dual informal labour market approach,"Purpose To transcend the long-standing debate regarding whether workers are driven into the informal economy by either their involuntary “exclusion” or voluntary “exit” from the formal economy, the purpose of this paper is to propose and evaluate the existence of a dual informal labour market composed of an exit-driven “upper tier” and an exclusion-driven “lower-tier” of informal workers, and to explore its policy implications.   Design/methodology/approach To do so, data are reported from a 2015 survey of the informal economy conducted in South-East Europe involving 6,019 face-to-face interviews in Bulgaria, Croatia and FYR Macedonia.   Findings Identifying a dual informal labour market with three exit-driven informal workers for every exclusion-driven informal worker, a multinomial logit regression analysis reveals that, compared to the exclusion-driven “lower tier”, the exit-driven “upper tier” is significantly more likely to be populated by the formally employed, retired and those not struggling financially. Participation is not affected by the perceived severity of penalties and likely risks of detection, but relative to those in the exclusion-driven “lower tier”, there is a significant correlation between those doing so for exit rationales and their lack of both horizontal trust and vertical trust in formal institutions.   Practical implications The outcome is a call to transcend the conventional deterrence approach of increasing the penalties and risks of detection. Instead, to tackle those driven by exit rationales, tackling both the lack of horizontal trust that other citizens are operating in a compliant manner and the lack of vertical trust in formal institutions is advocated. To tackle exclusion-driven informal workers, meanwhile, a focus upon the macro-level economic and social conditions which lead to their participation is required.   Originality/value This is the first paper to empirically evaluate the existence of a dual informal labour market and to evaluate its policy implications.",Employee Relations,2018,Volume 40,Issue 5,889-902,"Williams, Colin Charles;

pub.1106274916,10.1111/pafo.12121,Considering a Chinese Sphere of Influence: North Korean Nuclear Weapons Should Not Be an American Problem,"Twenty years from now, the Chinese economy might be twice as large as that of the United Sates. Since great powers have always claimed spheres of influence, this raises the issue of what characteristics a Chinese sphere of influence might have. Currently, the Chinese sphere of influence is still rather fuzzy. But one might argue that North Korea is part of it. After all, the Chinese fought the Korean War in order to prevent all of Korea becoming part of the US sphere of influence. If one accepts that North Korea is part of the Chinese sphere of influence, then Kim Jong‐un's nuclear weapons should become a Chinese concern instead of a US concern. If China wants a nuclear weapons power next door, and a joint missile defense effort by the United States, Japan, and South Korea because of it so be it. If China understands its national interest, as great powers have historically done, then it could undermine the North Korean regime more effectively than the United States could at much lower risks of escalation to a great war. Whereas the United States hesitates to recognize that North Korea is and should remain part of the Chinese sphere of influence, its economic sanctions against Russia risk driving Russia into China's arms. Focusing on the incipient rivalry between China and the United States for global primacy does in no way imply advocacy of a hawkish US policy towards China. In the nuclear age, peace between rival powers should depend on two pillars: nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence, or “peace by fear” and “peace by trade.”",Pacific Focus,2018,33,2,330-351,"Weede, Erich",University of Bonn,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1106274916,0,"[Inglehart, Ronald F; Puranen, Bi; Welzel, Christian]|[ur.016342014443.71; ur.07410345455.17; ur.01347314655.00]|Journal of Peace Research|2015|52|4|418-434|10.1177/0022343314565756|pub.1000772236|21;[Weede, Erich]|[ur.016314553557.91]|Constitutional Political Economy|1996|7|3|167-176|10.1007/bf00128160|pub.1009072891|32;[Bleaney, Michael; Nishiyama, Akira]|[ur.015016612205.82; ]|Journal of Economic Growth|2002|7|1|43-56|10.1023/a:1013466526642|pub.1011599431|86;[Morgan, T.

Especially, he put emphasis on the need to ensure that extended deterrence by US nuclear weapons is always credible, while he acknowledges the miseries of nuclear weapons. In the face of growing threat of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programme, Ishiba also noted that Japan’s policy of not allowing the introduction of nuclear weapons in its territory should be re-examined, effectively casting doubt on the third pillar of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. Missile defence is another item that he thinks must be strengthened to enhance the credibility of nuclear deterrence.

pub.1107724704,10.1080/25751654.2018.1532525,Trump and the Interregnum of American Nuclear Hegemony,"Nuclear weapons are the ultimate power capacity of states. They make it possible to exterminate whole states, cities and peoples almost instantaneously. Because they are militarily unusable in almost any conceivable context, their main (but not only) use today is to deter other nuclear-armed states from using them first, by threatening nuclear retaliation. American nuclear hegemony combined the ideology of nuclear deterrence to legitimate nuclear alliances, embodied in institutional form as integrated force structures, and undergirded by uniquely threatening American nuclear forces. Since the end of the Cold War, this hegemony has declined. The first year of the Trump Administration revealed glimpses of Trump’s intention to exploit nuclear threat, formalized in his Nuclear Posture Review and nuclear modernization budgets.

Explaining the non-use of nuclear weapons during the Indo-Pakistani post-tests nuclear crises,"The literature on the India–Pakistan nuclear conundrum has neglected the impact of the international normative environment on India and Pakistan’s nuclear behavior. This article fills that gap, by looking at the impact of the nuclear taboo on Indo-Pakistani strategic interactions during the 1999 Kargil war and the 2002 border standoff. The nuclear taboo, rather than nuclear deterrence, explains the non-use of nuclear weapons. During both crises the nuclear taboo entered the decision-making process instrumentally, in the form of perceived reputational “costs.” The Indian and Pakistani emerging nuclear doctrines endanger a fragile nuclear taboo that would be strengthened by a bilateral non-first use accord. Whether India and Pakistan can move from an instrumental to a substantive acceptance of the nuclear taboo will depend on whether the United States and the other nuclear weapon states, included in the Nonproliferation Treaty, play the role of norm entrepreneurs and strengthen the nuclear taboo at the global level.",Contemporary Security Policy,2018,39,3,1-23,"Carranza, Mario E.",Texas A&M University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100293530,2,"[PRESS, DARYL G.; SAGAN, SCOTT D.; VALENTINO, BENJAMIN A.]|[ur.010130626705.72; ur.01045127243.12; ur.016200126625.29]|American Political Science Review|2013|107|1|188-206|10.1017/s0003055412000597|pub.1001757172|59;[Narang, Vipin]|[ur.015524123107.00]|International Security|2010|34|3|38-78|10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38|pub.1003337139|34;[Feiveson, Harold A.; Hogendoorn, Ernst Jan]|[; ]|The Nonproliferation Review|2003|10|2|90-98|10.1080/10736700308436933|pub.1006964811|4;[Yusuf, Moeed; Kirk, Jason A.]|[ur.012470306557.01; ur.014041153631.15]|Contemporary Security Policy|2016|37|2|1-27|10.1080/13523260.2016.1177954|pub.1015385407|1;[O’Donnell, Frank]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2017|38|1|1-24|10.1080/13523260.2016.1236470|pub.1016750786|1;[Khan, Feroz Hassan]|[ur.012272631263.24]|The Nonproliferation Review|2003|10|1|59-74|10.1080/10736700308436917|pub.1017905732|10;[Gizewski, Peter]|[]|International Journal Canada's Journal of Global Policy Analysis|1996|51|3|397-419|10.1177/002070209605100301|pub.1018759562|3;[Biswas, Arka]|[ur.015727011354.46]|Strategic Analysis|2015|39|6|683-695|10.1080/09700161.2015.1090682|pub.1024838378|3;[Hoyt, Timothy D.]|[]|Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia|2009|||144-170|10.1017/cbo9780511691805.007|pub.1025028850|5;[Paul, T.

This document does not only send a deterrence message to potential adversaries, but it is also an important reassurance to the allies and partners of the US. A NPR is traditionally in effect for a period of 5–10 years. The Trump administration’s 2018 NPR shows many continuities with previous strategies. However, it also implemented important changes, especially with regards to the number and composition of nuclear forces. The new NPR re-introduced two low-yield warhead types in response to the deteriorating relations with Russia and China. Unlike the former NPR, it put great power confrontation in the center of the document, instead of strategic stability. This shift in focus reflects a renewed emphasis on nuclear deterrence and modernizations, and a sceptical approach towards arms control measures. This paper examines how the administration’s deterrence policy has changed vis-à-vis Moscow and Beijing, why these changes were implemented, and how this shift affects the security of the allies of the US The author argues that the justification of the proposed modernization programs is questionable, and these steps might lead to a renewed arms race in low-yield nuclear capabilities.

The only effect considered is nuclear winter (“nuclear autumn” in the low weapons limits) and the resultant effects on the aggressor nation. First, the ability of low nuclear weapon limits is probed for maintaining deterrence in the worst-case scenario of attacking the most-populous nation. Second, the ability of aggressor nations to feed themselves is assessed without trade and industry resultant from a nuclear attack causing “nuclear autumn” (10% global agricultural shortfall). Third, the best-case wealthy aggressor nation with abundant arable land is analyzed for starvation and economic impacts given 7000, 1000, and 100 nuclear weapons scenarios. The results found that 100 nuclear warheads is adequate for nuclear deterrence in the worst case scenario, while using more than 100 nuclear weapons by any aggressor nation (including the best positioned strategically to handle the unintended consequences) even with optimistic assumptions (including no retaliation) would cause unacceptable damage to their own society.

pub.1104226693,10.3390/socsci7060082,"From Just War to Nuclear Pacifism: The Evolution of U.S. Christian Thinking about War in the Nuclear Age, 1946–1989","During the Cold War, two basic schools of thought emerged among U.S. Christian leaders and ethicists concerning the implications of the nuclear revolution for the use of force by the United States. The just war thinkers held that nuclear war could in fact be conducted within the bounds of traditional just war principles, particularly those of discrimination and proportionality. Since nuclear weapons could be used in war, it followed that they could and should be developed and produced for that purpose and for the purpose of deterrence. The nuclear pacifists held that nuclear war could not be conducted within the confines of traditional just war principles. Since by its nature nuclear war could not be moral, there was no reason for the development and production of nuclear weapons, except for the purpose of deterrence. And since nuclear deterrence required one to make threats of nuclear destruction that it would not be moral to carry out, and, moreover, carried unacceptable risks of miscalculation and inadvertent or accidental use of nuclear weapons, deterrence itself could not be justified, except perhaps as a temporary way station on the path to nuclear disarmament. Although the just war thinkers initially held sway, over time they became less dominant. By the middle of the 1980s, the U.S. Catholic Church and most of the largest Mainline Protestant denominations had formally adopted a nuclear pacifist position. This essay chronicles the victory of nuclear pacifism in these churches, explains it as a reaction to the nuclear weapons and doctrine advocated by the just war thinkers, and implemented by the U.S. government and military, as well as other events and trends in American society, and inquires as to whether or not the just war thinkers and nuclear pacifists influenced the course of U.S. policy.",Social Sciences,2018,7,6,82,"Rock, Stephen R.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104226693,0,"[McBrady, Jared]|[]|Journal of Cold War Studies|2015|17|1|129-152|10.1162/jcws_a_00533|pub.1000907033|2;[Pavlischek, Keith]|[]|Christianity and Power Politics Today|2008|||53-71|10.1057/9780230610538_3|pub.1036642220|2;[Van Kirk, Walter William]|[ur.016060347745.76]|The Ecumenical Review|1954|7|1|42-48|10.1111/j.1758-6623.1954.tb01723.x|pub.1042679640|1;[Boyer, Paul]|[]|Journal of American History|1984|70|4|821|10.2307/1899750|pub.1069631091|19;[Slocombe, Walter]|[]|International Security|1981|5|4|18|10.2307/2538711|pub.1069980392|17;[Sagan, Scott D.; Valentino, Benjamin A.]|[ur.01045127243.12; ur.016200126625.29]|International Security|2017|42|1|41-79|10.1162/isec_a_00284|pub.1090954125|37;[Yankelovich, Daniel; Doble, John]|[; ]|Foreign Affairs|1984|63|1|33|10.2307/20042083|pub.1102764211|28"

By the middle 1980s, the Chinese military had successfully developed China’s first generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), and communication satellites, which provided China with an elementary and limited second-strike capability. These technological advances were complemented by advances in Chinese nuclear strategy as well. Despite retaining the basic principle of no-first-use of nuclear weapons, the Chinese military leaders, such as Deng and General Zhang Aiping, gradually accepted the concept of nuclear deterrence. Meanwhile, they put forward China’s own concepts, including ‘da gou gun’ (‘dog-beating stick’), ‘huan shou zhi li’ (‘the power to strike back’), ‘xia hu ren’ (‘bluff’), and ‘di you wo you, di yong wo yong’ (‘we have whatever the enemy has; we use whatever the enemy uses’). All of these new strategic weapons and concepts, which came from the 1980s, have been playing a key role in ensuring that China enjoyed limited nuclear deterrent since the late 1980s. Zhang devoted most of his attention to these achievements.",,2018,,,1-17,"Liu, Lei",Ocean University of China,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103996989,1,

It highlights the work’s contribution to the otherwise undertheorized role of third parties in preventing war, its fresh perspectives on the optimism-pessimism debate on nuclear deterrence, and its attention to scholarship on nonnuclear subjects, primarily mediation, unipolarity theory, and sociological literature on “evaluation” by external audiences. The discussion highlights policy recommendations for decision makers in the United States, other third-party states, India, Pakistan, and other potential regional nuclear rivals.

This entailed the United States and other major powers ignoring Pakistan’s effort to manipulate the risk of war and its pleas for support to help terminate the crisis while it was in possession of forcibly occupied territory in Indian Kashmir. They deemed Pakistan’s unilateral withdrawal to be the most realistic and efficient way of ensuring crisis termination. India reacted militarily to Pakistan’s provocation but kept its actions limited to retain international goodwill and get the third party to make efforts to ensure Pakistan’s withdrawal. The chapter also analyzes the several risks of escalation introduced due to India’s and Pakistan’s misperceptions of the third party’s outlook toward the crisis.",Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environments,2018,,,53-82,"Yusuf, Moeed",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111706570,0,

China's military spending, which was half that of Japan's in 1996, is now three and a half times as large. Japan has taken a range of measures to buttress its military forces and loosen the restrictions on their operations, but much remains to be done. Most important, Tokyo needs to reexamine its strategy to maximize Japan's deterrent leverage. Of the three general approaches to conventional deterrence—punishment, forward defense, and denial—Japan's best option is to shift to a denial strategy. Such a strategy, built around a resilient force that can survive attack and attrite an encroaching adversary, can make the risks to a potential attacker unacceptably high. In Japan's case, such a strategy would leverage the inherent dangers that Beijing would face in contemplating a prolonged war against Japan and its U.S. ally. The strategy, updated to reflect the imperatives of air and maritime warfare in the precision strike era, would require a high level of dispersion and mobility and might therefore be labeled “active denial.” Adopting an active denial strategy would buttress Japan's defense and deterrent capability while reducing first-strike incentives and improving crisis stability.",International Security,2018,42,04,128-169,"Heginbotham, Eric; Samuels, Richard J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103793830,7,"[Heginbotham, Eric; Heim, Jacob L.]|[ur.011077633057.88; ur.013672306667.70]|The Washington Quarterly|2015|38|1|185-199|10.1080/0163660x.2015.1038189|pub.1002904893|6;[Montgomery, Evan Braden]|[ur.015471165420.06]|International Security|2014|38|4|115-149|10.1162/isec_a_00160|pub.1011069335|39;[Biddle, Stephen; Oelrich, Ivan]|[ur.013061461177.45; ur.013657041577.58]|International Security|2016|41|1|7-48|10.1162/isec_a_00249|pub.1013503550|31;[Liff, Adam P.]|[ur.013410144521.45]|The Washington Quarterly|2015|38|2|79-99|10.1080/0163660x.2015.1064711|pub.1016648126|31;[Glaser, Charles L.; Kaufmann, Chairn]|[; ]|International Security|1998|22|4|44-82|10.1162/isec.22.4.44|pub.1031288443|39;[Wilkening, Dean A.]|[ur.0670715150.99]|Science & Global Security|2004|12|1-2|1-67|10.1080/08929880490464649|pub.1050489965|17;[Mearsheimer, John J.]|[]|International Security|1981|6|3|104|10.2307/2538609|pub.1069980301|11;[Evera, Stephen Van]|[ur.013530612333.14]|International Security|1984|9|1|58|10.2307/2538636|pub.1069980326|136;[Snyder, Jack]|[]|International Security|1984|9|1|108|10.2307/2538637|pub.1069980327|76;[Huntington, Samuel P.]|[]|International Security|1983|8|3|32|10.2307/2538699|pub.1069980381|46;[Liff, Adam P.]|[ur.013410144521.45]|Asia Policy|2017|24|1|139-172|10.1353/asp.2017.0035|pub.1091204674|4;[Beckley, Michael]|[]|International Security|2017|42|2|78-119|10.1162/isec_a_00294|pub.1092485059|19;[Nye, Joseph S.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1995|74|4|90|10.2307/20047210|pub.1102760097|46;[Auer, James E.]|[]|Law and Contemporary Problems|1990|53|2|171|10.2307/1191849|pub.1102778651|4"
pub.1103206216,10.3390/socsci7040060,The English Catholic New Left: Battling the Religious Establishment and the Politics of the Cold War,"In the 1960s there appeared in England a group of young university educated Catholics who sought to merge radical Catholic social teachings with the ideas of Karl Marx and the latest insights of European and American sociologists and literary theorists. They were known as the English Catholic New Left (ECNL). Under the inspiration of their Dominican mentors, they launched a magazine called Slant that served as the vehicle for publishing their ideas about how Catholic theology along with the Social Gospels fused with neo-Marxism could bring a humanistic socialist revolution to Britain. The Catholic Leftists worked in alliance with the activists of the secular New Left Review to achieve this objective. A major influence on the ECNL was the Marxist Dominican friar Laurence Bright and Herbert McCabe, O. P. Slant took off with great success when Sheed and Ward agreed to publish the journal. Slant featured perceptive, indeed at times brilliant, cutting-edge articles by the Catholic Left’s young Turks, including Terry Eagleton, Martin Redfern, Bernard Sharratt, and Angela and Adrian Cunningham, among others. A major target of the Slant project was the Western Alliance’s Cold War strategy of nuclear deterrence, which they saw to be contrary to Christian just war theory and ultimately destructive of humankind. Another matter of concern for the Slant group was capitalist imperialism that ravaged the underdeveloped world and was a major destabilizing factor for achieving world peace and social equality. Despite their failure to achieve a social revolution “baptized by Christianity,” the English Catholic New Left broke new ground in terms of showing how a traditional religion with a highly conservative and sometimes reactionary history had the capacity to offer new paths forward and remain an inspiration to progressive thinking Christians trying to navigate the shoals of a post-modern world.",Social Sciences,2018,7,4,60,"Corrin, Jay P.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103206216,0,"[Wicker, Brian]|[]|New Blackfriars|1999|80|944|436-443|10.1111/j.1741-2005.1999.tb01698.x|pub.1005400907|1;[]|[]|New Blackfriars|1967|49|571|140-148|10.1111/j.1741-2005.1967.tb01144.x|pub.1026001543|1;[Corrin, Jay P.]|[ur.014464630615.29]|Journal of Church and State|2015|||csv090|10.1093/jcs/csv090|pub.1059753805|1;[CUNNINGHAM, A.]|[]|The Year's Work in Critical and Cultural Theory|1991|1|1|210-215|10.1093/ywcct/1.1.210|pub.1060068927|1;[Gilley, Sheridan]|[]|The Chesterton Review|1992|18|4|485-499|10.5840/chesterton199218496|pub.1073173537|1"

Japanese scientists opposed the Cold War order from the superpowers on down. Against the backdrop of the intensifying nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union, Pugwash scientists came to accept a key notion by the mid-1960s; namely, that stable mutual deterrence is a prerequisite for averting nuclear war and promoting nuclear arms control. Under such circumstances, the Japanese Pugwash scientists began to criticize nuclear deterrence in the early 1960s in Japanese society.

It analyzes the growing danger of destructive cyber weapons in the future joint operating environment and the devastating effects they may have in the physical domain. Further, it outlines evidence that specifically coded, offensive destructive cyber weapons would meet the spirit and intent of the three academic conditions for categorization as WMD. It argues the merits of categorizing a class of destructive cyber weapons as WMD, and addresses important factors required to examine advantages afforded to policy makers. Towards this end, the paper offers two recommendations for consideration to account for the value in designating a class of destructive cyber weapons as WMD. The recommendations include a proposed cyber deterrence theory of “Attributed Response Assured,” and outline how this theory could support a U.S. cyber policy of strategic ambiguity. Further, it recommends defining acceptable behaviors for cyber activity by the international community. In the absence of a U.N.-led effort, the establishment of a Proliferation Security Initiative-type agreement could further steps to clarify “norms” and communicate “redlines” to potential adversaries. These steps would assist policy makers in the collective effort towards enabling the security of a networked world against the most dangerous cyber threats capable of causing mass casualties or mass destruction.",Journal of Strategic Security,2018,11,1,43-61,"Hatch, Benjamin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103540345,2,

Over the course of the nuclear era, a great debate on this question has occurred in three quite different rounds. In the first round, “nuclear one world” ideas about the obsolescence of the state-system and necessity of a world state predominated, but reached both conceptual and practical impasses. In the second round, across much of the Cold War, a trinity of deterrence-centered approaches, simple deterrence, war strategism, and arms control, prevailed. In the currently unfolding third round, proliferation and leakage have weakened confidence in nuclear deterrence, while both war strategism and arms control have become more radical, offering opposite “bombs away” answers of coercive counter-proliferation and preventive war, and deep arms control and nuclear abolition.",The Oxford Handbook of International Security,2018,,,333-349,"Deudney, Daniel",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114070138,0,

In particular, the different levels of cooperation between South Korea and the United States may affect the regional security order in East Asia.

North Korea’s six nuclear weapons experiments with various types of missile test fires using solid fuel and new technology pose a security threat to South Korea and the USA. The credibility of the North’s WMD capability and the military balance of two Koreas are critically analyzed. South Korea’s superior conventional weapons system, supported by U.S. strategic weapons and intelligence systems, could fend off North Korean nuclear weapons and missile attacks. However, it is imperative that the U.S.-ROK alliance continues to develop a stringent nuclear deterrence strategy and deploy a series of countermeasures, including preemptive strikes and a multilayered missile defense system, such as Kill Chain, KAMD, and THAAD, all to guard against a potential nuclear weapon attack from North Korea.",East Asia,2018,35,1,1-21,"Kwon, Edward",Northern Kentucky University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101345627,2,"[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[; ]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2016|72|2|63-73|10.1080/00963402.2016.1145901|pub.1001137895|5;[CHA, VICTOR D.]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|2002|117|2|209-230|10.2307/798181|pub.1001730076|17;[Zagare, Frank C.]|[ur.014447021551.60]|Journal of Theoretical Politics|2004|16|2|107-141|10.1177/0951629804041117|pub.1009291998|33;[Kim, Nan]|[]|The Journal of Asian Studies|2011|70|2|337-356|10.1017/s0021911811000908|pub.1010637277|9;[Gompert, David C.]|[]|Survival|2013|55|3|21-46|10.1080/00396338.2013.802849|pub.1018863077|1;[Snyder, Glenn Herald]|[]||1961||||10.1515/9781400877164|pub.1018970969|179;[O'Hanlon, Michael]|[]|International Security|1998|22|4|135-170|10.1162/isec.22.4.135|pub.1021857235|16;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|International Security|1997|21|3|54-86|10.1162/isec.21.3.54|pub.1035180213|60;[Cha, Victor D.]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2009|32|4|119-138|10.1080/01636600903224837|pub.1038378164|13;[MARTIN, CURTIS H.]|[]|Journal of Peace Research|2002|39|1|51-68|10.1177/0022343302039001003|pub.1053766669|9;[Huth, Paul K.]|[ur.016301126663.22]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1990|34|2|270-290|10.1177/0022002790034002005|pub.1063626354|36;[]|[]||2012||||10.21236/ada582894|pub.1091606055|12"
pub.1100590438,10.1080/09592296.2017.1420526,On Extended Nuclear Deterrence,"This analysis discusses the central challenges that countries face when they practice extended nuclear deterrence. One key problem has to do with credibility: potential aggressors may not believe that a country would fight to defend an ally, particularly if doing so risks a nuclear attack against its homeland. Countries might be able to address this issue by forging formal alliances with protégés or by stationing nuclear forces on the protégé’s territory. Do these measures discourage third-party aggression? Defence pacts involving nuclear-armed states effectively bolster extended deterrence. One risk of extending nuclear protection from the American perspective, however, is that it might pull the United States into unwanted wars by risk-acceptant protégés. Yet, in a nuclear context, the risk of alliance entrapment is generally overblown. Placing nuclear weapons on an ally’s territory does much less to bolster extended deterrence than one might initially think. Although foreign nuclear deployments may reassure allies and promote non-proliferation to some degree, their value for extended deterrence is fairly minimal. The United States continues to deploy nuclear weapons in five European countries, but the case for maintaining these deployments is decidedly weak.",Diplomacy and Statecraft,2018,29,1,1-23,"Fuhrmann, Matthew",Texas A&M University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100590438,3,

Missile Defenses and Russian-American Nuclear Arms Control,"Missile defenses have been bones of contention in past arms control negotiations as between the United States and Russia. The likelihood is that ballistic missile defenses (BMD) for protection of the U.S. homeland or for the defense of regional allies in Europe and elsewhere will be of greater interest in view of their maturing technologies and emerging regional threats. On the other hand, the deployment of next generation missile defenses is not an isolated issue. From the standpoint of nuclear deterrence, missile defenses are embedded within a larger framework of emerging technologies, including those for conventional prompt global strike, for cyber warfare, and for the modernization of offensive strategic nuclear forces.",The Journal of Slavic Military Studies,2018,31,1,2-14,"Cimbala, Stephen J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100947146,0,

The benefits of a no first use policy in promoting nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation and in preventing the start of a nuclear war by accident or by miscalculations are clear. However, except for a brief period under the Democratic administration, the Japanese Government has insisted that the US reject the no first use policy. Even though practical US dependence on nuclear weapons has markedly declined, realists still cling to nuclear deterrence and the retention of the first use option. The strict application of international humanitarian law principles further limits cases where nuclear weapons can be used. The deep divide between the proponents and opponents of nuclear weapons has to be overcome for Japan to support the US no first use policy. There is, thus, a need to explore ways to bridge this divide. To this end, the divide between the proponents and opponents of no first use should be analyzed in detail based on the current military and security situation in the region.",Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament,2018,1,1,137-151,"Abe, Nobuyasu",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101796471,1,"[Fetter, Steve; Wolfsthal, Jon]|[ur.010107403101.87; ]|Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament|2018|1|1|102-114|10.1080/25751654.2018.1454257|pub.1101836034|6"

Nuclear weapons supposedly had little or no remaining role to play in US security; the only real questions were how, and how quickly could the United States lead the world to nuclear disarmament. The end of the Cold War, which left the United States as the only standing Superpower inspired this view of history, nuclear deterrence, and nuclear weapons. With the nuclear resurgence of Russia, the rise of China, the mounting nuclear threats from North Korea and potentially Iran, that foundational belief underlying US inattention to its nuclear arsenal is now a manifest fiction, and US nuclear policy must confront, and adjust to a very different reality.",Comparative Strategy,2018,37,1,1-8,"Payne, Keith B.",National Institute for Public Policy,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101083214,0,
pub.1103812855,10.1007/978-3-319-75307-2_5,Cyber Deterrence Theory and Practise,"This chapter evaluates the feasibility of cyber deterrence strategies. In the past few years, cyberspace has been the centre of attention for military policymakers, with states racing to assert their dominance and superiority. As with the advent of aerial warfare and air power in the first half of the twentieth century, the cyber domain has seen a rapid influx of technology. This praxis has outpaced theoretical formulation and conceptual development, with the result being that old strategies are being transposed to the new domain. Deterrence is chief among these but suffers from significant problems, as it has been fundamentally shaped by the nuclear era. The nature of cyberspace as characterised by immateriality and supranationality, with a preponderance of non-state actors, makes the rule sets that defined nuclear deterrence inapplicable. Exacerbating these issues are the real difficulties of achieving credibility and the attribution problem. The cyber deterrence strategies that have hereunto been expounded do not seem to heed these issues, but instead inflame a dangerous rhetoric that fuels a particularly volatile arms race. As an initial step towards ameliorating this situation, this chapter concludes by offering two rudimentary policy suggestions.","Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering",2018,93,,63-81,"Haggman, Andreas",Royal Holloway University of London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103812855,0,"[Ablon, Lillian; Libicki, Martin]|[ur.015720542270.95; ]|Defense Counsel Journal|2015|82|2|143-152|10.12690/0161-8202-82.2.143|pub.1036202227|13;[Arquilla, John; Ronfeldt, David]|[ur.015662377347.72; ur.013665643773.40]|Comparative Strategy|1993|12|2|141-165|10.1080/01495939308402915|pub.1052253404|157;[Pearlman, Wendy; Cunningham, Kathleen Gallagher]|[ur.011562202776.10; ur.010511120001.95]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2012|56|1|3-15|10.1177/0022002711429669|pub.1063625504|50;[Freedman, Ariela]|[]|Journal of Modern Literature|2004|27|3|47-62|10.2979/jml.2004.27.3.47|pub.1070939468|2;[Hauben, Michael; Hauben, Ronda]|[ur.016211213255.52; ur.07650465037.59]|First Monday|1998|3|7||10.5210/fm.v3i7.605|pub.1072710432|84;[Johnson, David R.; Post, David]|[; ]|Stanford Law Review|1996|48|5|1367|10.2307/1229390|pub.1102024107|188;[Mele, Stefano]|[]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2013||||10.2139/ssrn.2518212|pub.1102419339|7;[Roper, Carl]|[]||2013||||10.1201/b16112|pub.1108581841|9"

Drawing from recent findings in the life sciences, this article offers a cultural neuroscience approach to deterrence decision-making, with special attention given to the ways in which culture interacts with cognition and the security environment to shape behavioral outcomes during conflict. Since North Korea remains largely a ""black box"" in international relations, a cultural neuroscience perspective can provide valuable insight into the effects of cultural conditioning on perception and cognition within the context of nuclear deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.

By focusing on efforts to halt Russian and Chinese cyber operations against the United States this paper examines the importance of developing, maintaining and implementing (when necessary) cross domain deterrence strategies. This paper departs from more theoretic debates on the value and potential success, or lack thereof relating to cyber deterrence strategies and focuses on two cases in which cross domain retaliations were utilized to halt adversary behavior.

The imposition of costs on adversaries in cyberspace is extremely complex and the establishment deterrence by threat or denial is constrained by problems associated with resource asymmetries, attribution, and a diverse set of actors with overlapping capabilities. Due to these challenges, conventional models of deterrence have seen limited success in cyberspace. Rather than building more robust defenses or threatening retaliatory actions technical entanglement within cyberspace offers an alternative approach that might affect the decision-matrix of adversary states. This paper examines the concept of technical entanglement as a way of altering how states conceptualize offensive actions cyberspace and works towards building mutual inter-dependencies to make actions that disrupt, degrade or deny within cyberspace undesirable.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2018,,,,"Brantly, Aaron",Virginia Tech,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104588961,0,

Despite the growing literature on cyber security, most studies have sidestepped important questions of how conflict escalates in the cyber domain. To better understand this dynamic, we advance two main theoretical pathways of escalation, one in which actors respond with increasing intensity based on the effect of an attack, irrespective of how it is conducted (through cyber, conventional, or nuclear) and another in which the means of attack determines the actor’s willingness to escalate. We then test those effects- and means-based pathways with an original experiment that probes support for escalation, focusing on the American public, a key actor in debates about nuclear escalation and deterrence. Our study suggests that cyber attacks create a threshold that restrains the escalation of conflict. Americans are less likely to support retaliation with force when the scenario involves a cyber attack even when they perceive the magnitude of attacks across domains to be comparable. Our findings therefore cast doubt on the credibility of policy maker assertions that cyber attacks will be treated “like any other attack” and more broadly the logic of cyber deterrence that rests on the U.S. having the political resolve to retaliate for a cyber attack.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2018,,,,"Kreps, Sarah E.; Schneider, Jacquelyn",Cornell University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1100907840,4,

At the same time, cybersecurity issues have been catapulted into the highest of high politics: cyberpolitics. The objective of this chapter is to encourage political decision-makers (and others) to create a framework of proportionate ways to respond to different kinds of cyber hostility. The proportionate response is a complicated, situational political question. This chapter creates a context for the contemporary politics of cyber affairs in the world and determines five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to a cyber attack. As offensive cyber activity becomes more prevalent, policymakers will be challenged to develop proportionate responses to disruptive or destructive attacks. There has already been significant pressure to “do something” in the light of the alleged state-sponsored attacks. Past experience suggests that most policy responses are ad hoc. This chapter comprehensively analyzes how cyber attacks should be treated as a political question and represents a rough framework for policymakers to build on. The chapter presents five variables that policymakers need to consider when evaluating appropriate responses to cyber hostilities. Combining incident impact, policy options, and other variables, the framework outlines the different levers of cyberpolitics that can be applied in response to the escalating levels of cyber incidents. The response framework is also an integral part of the state’s cyber deterrence.","Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering",2018,93,,31-48,"Limnéll, Jarno",Aalto University,Finland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103809509,0,"[Kaldor, Mary]|[ur.0654736264.62]|Global Policy|2010|1|3|271-281|10.1111/j.1758-5899.2010.00041.x|pub.1015793194|23;[]|[]||2014||||10.1007/978-3-642-37481-4|pub.1023830655|16;[Thomas, Timothy]|[]|Defence Studies|2014|14|4|370-393|10.1080/14702436.2014.952522|pub.1027874211|3;[Radziwill, Yaroslav]|[ur.07733223563.16]||2015||||10.1163/9789004298309|pub.1030331697|6;[Rid, Thomas; Buchanan, Ben]|[ur.010444241522.28; ur.013432143522.19]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2015|38|1-2|4-37|10.1080/01402390.2014.977382|pub.1035532991|130;[Bronk, Christopher; Tikk-Ringas, Eneken]|[; ur.010366314221.07]|Survival|2013|55|2|81-96|10.1080/00396338.2013.784468|pub.1040421337|66;[Limnéll, Jarno]|[ur.012122154476.31]|International Journal of Cyber-Security and Digital Forensics|2015|4|4|521-532|10.17781/p001973|pub.1068457477|1;[van Haaster, Jelle]|[ur.010553570053.59]|2016 8th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon)|2016|||7-21|10.1109/cycon.2016.7529423|pub.1094586560|3;[Mačák, Kubo]|[ur.012416445176.08]|2016 8th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon)|2016|||127-139|10.1109/cycon.2016.7529431|pub.1095457773|4;[Valeriano, Brandon; Maness, Ryan C.]|[ur.013636643561.19; ur.013041263161.39]||2015||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190204792.001.0001|pub.1098742471|77;[Roscini, Marco]|[]||2014||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199655014.001.0001|pub.1098765702|34"

Commonly held deterrence theory is based on the balance of military capabilities between the belligerents. Thus, traditional deterrence theory suggests that to deter a potential enemy one has to have stronger military capabilities and thereby, the weak is virtually precluded from the possibility of deterring a considerably stronger opponent. It makes me wonder that if it holds good always, then how a country like Bangladesh will be able to deter its potential big adversaries. Is deterrence possible for Bangladesh without resorting to an arms race? However, recent outcomes of some asymmetric conflicts suggest that supremacy in military capability and economic power are not always the prime determinant of deterrence. Therefore, though geo-strategic and economic realities do not suggest Bangladesh to boost its military arsenal to attain conventional deterrence ability, yet there might be a window of opportunities open for Bangladesh to deter its potential adversaries. Therefore, in my research, I tried to figure out the possibility where a weak actor will able to deter a stronger one by adopting unconventional strategy. I tend to call it ‘Unorthodox Deterrence’.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2018,,,,"Azam, Mahmud",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129538775,0,"[Woodworth, P.]|[]|Survival|2001|43|4|157-158|10.1093/survival/43.4.157|pub.1014983047|16"

These are the questions that this paper intends to address.

pub.1119869977,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.481,Signaling in Foreign Policy,"Costly signaling offers a solution to many foreign policy dilemmas. Though most commonly studied in the context of the bargaining theory of war, signaling can also play an important role in nonzero-sum interactions such as those characterized by chicken (e.g., nuclear deterrence) and the prisoner’s dilemma (e.g., tariff reductions). A rich game theoretic literature explains how actors can signal credibly in these situations. The most prominent strategies are sinking costs (actions that are costly ex ante) or tying hands (actions that are costly ex post). These strategies are theoretically elegant but have generated considerable controversy when studied empirically. One controversy concerns the existence of hand-tying domestic audience costs under different regime types. A second controversy involves the degree to which sinking costs increase or decrease the risk of war. These controversies speak to the inherent tension between theories of strategic interactions and measuring their outcomes in the foreign policy process, where some events are off the equilibrium path and thus unobserved. The limited availability of foreign policy data was a major hindrance in earlier empirical efforts. Even as the quality of this data has improved, focus has been on the outcomes of conflict (crisis onset, escalation to war, victory, defeat) rather than the strategy. This is problematic given that all crises are sequential in nature and understanding the action–reaction cycle is vital to illuminating patterns of war, capitulation, and settlement. The frontier of research in the signaling literature is in bridging this gap. The advent of big data and machine learning has enabled more systematic empirical analysis of strategic moves by various foreign policy actors, including signaling. Some researchers, such as Lindsay & Gartzke, are harnessing these new data and methods to explore the means of signaling. Other scholars are beginning to ask questions about the efficacy of public versus private signaling, the role of ambiguity, and dyadic versus multi-actor signaling. This new wave of research seeks to nudge signaling closer to the concerns of foreign policy practitioners.",Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics,2017,,,,"Gartzke, Erik A.; Carcelli, Shannon; Gannon, J Andres; Zhang, Jiakun Jack",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1119869977,0,

However, cumulative knowledge relating to the effects of nuclear weapons possession on conflict interaction is largely absent. Framework is provided for analyzing the results of quantitative empirical research on this question and to identify any extant strong and consistent patterns in the interactions of states that can be associated with the possession of nuclear weapons. Since 1945, a vast, sophisticated, and contradictory literature has developed on the implications of nuclear weaponry for patterns of international conflict and war. This theoretical and empirical work has principally focused on the conflict effects of these weapons for the interaction of nuclear-armed states, although a growing number of studies have explored the impact of a state’s possession of nuclear weapons on the behavior of nonnuclear opponents. Given the destructive capacity of these weapons and their questionable value for battlefield use, most of this work has concentrated on the requirements for successful deterrence. In categorizing the studies, some scholars note that “classical deterrence theory” derives from the Realist paradigm of international politics and subdivide this theory into two complementary strands: structural (or neorealist) deterrence theory and decision-theoretic deterrence theory. In contrast, other analysts choose to classify work on nuclear deterrence into three schools of thought: nuclear irrelevance; risk manipulation, escalation, and limited war; and the nuclear revolution. The essence of these divisions involves a debate about what the possession of nuclear weapons does for a state that controls them. Does the possession of these weapons affect the behavior of nuclear and nonnuclear opponents in disputes over contested values? Do the weapons impart political influence and hold military utility, or are they useless as tools for deterrence, compellence, or war?",Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics,2017,,,,"Geller, Daniel S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115222073,1,
pub.1120294482,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.572,The Concept of Deterrence and Deterrence Theory,"Deterrence is an old practice, readily defined and described, widely employed but unevenly effective and of questionable reliability. Elevated to prominence after World War II and the arrival of nuclear weapons, deterrence became the central recourse for sustaining international and internal security and stability among and within states in an era of serious conflict. With regard to the presence of nuclear weapons in particular but also to deal with non-nuclear violent conflict, deterrence has been employed to prevent (or at least limit) the destruction of states, societies, and ultimately humanity. The greatest success has been that no nuclear weapons have been used for destructive purposes since the end of World War II in 1945. Deterrence has been widely used below the nuclear level but with very uneven results. Deterrence has been intensively studied and tested as to its use in terms of strategy in international relations, the maintenance of stability in international relations, the conduct of violence and warfare in both international and domestic contexts, and in political affairs. Since deterrence is the use of threats to block or reduce the inflicting of serious harm, the existence of capacities for inflicting harm are readily maintained and periodically applied, so available deterrence capabilities provide a degree of continuing concern and a regular desire to at least do away with nuclear weapons and threats. A brief period in the ending of the Cold War saw a serious effort to reduce the reliance on deterrence, particularly nuclear deterrence, in international politics but it was soon replaced by serious movement in the opposite direction. Yet efforts to reduce the need for and use of deterrence continue. Extensive efforts have been applied in the development of theories of deterrence, particularly to generate empirical theory in order to better understand and apply deterrence but without arriving at widely accepted results. This is the result of the considerable complexity of the subject, the activity involved, and the behavior of the practitioners. The conduct of deterrence is now broader and deeper than before. It is under greater pressure due to technological, political, and cultural developments, and operates in a much more elaborate overall environment including space, cyberspace, and oceanic environs. Thus the goal of developing effective empirical theory on deterrence remains, at various levels, still incompletely attained. The same is true of mastering deterrence in practice. Nevertheless, deterrence remains important and fascinating.",Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics,2017,,,,"Morgan, Patrick M.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120294482,1,

The renewed crisis between the West (the United States and NATO member states) and Russia demonstrates how critical these elements are to the strategic nuclear relationship. As a result of recent setbacks between Washington and Moscow in the past few years, arms control has taken a back seat, and the risk of conflict due to miscalculation is the highest it has been since the 1980s. If the United States and Russia want to rebuild trust and continue reducing the risk of nuclear use, a meaningful dialogue is needed to reconcile nuclear deterrence and nuclear arms control. How can the world’s two largest nuclear superpowers re-establish the harmony that once existed between deterrence and arms control? What should a stable framework look like for managing that nuclear relationship, taking into account other regional security challenges? The answer to these questions lies in establishing a new, common interpretation of US–Russian strategic stability. Both parties need to find mutually acceptable solutions to the challenges of reconciling nuclear deterrence and arms control.

Russia’s large-scale exercises incorporate the scenarios of a limited nuclear strike against NATO as part of Moscow’s “escalation to de-escalate” concept. Russia has acquired an edge over NATO in tactical nuclear weaponry and is expanding the range of tactical delivery systems. Moscow’s political rhetoric includes nuclear threats toward the West. NATO’s range of response options to such threats and limited nuclear war scenarios has shrunk considerably, and the alliance to lacks the collective will to call those threats a bluff. Because of Russia’s regional superiority in conventional forces and its anti-access/area denial capabilities, the Baltic area is particularly vulnerable. Despite deployment of Enhanced Forward Presence units to the eastern flank members, NATO still relies on deterrence by punishment to prevent the possibility of Russian military attack in the area. But Russia’s posture and capabilities could allow it to seize the Baltics, establishing a relatively quick fait accompli that it then defends by issuing nuclear threats.

As well, information attacks on command-control and communications systems might lead to a mistaken nuclear launch based on false warnings, to erroneous interpretations of data or to panic on account of feared information blackout.

pub.1090309166,10.4018/ijcwt.2017070101,Cyberspace: The New Battlefield - An Approach via the Analytics Hierarchy Process,"The transition of the warfare mentality from the conventional domains of engagement (air, land, maritime, and space) to the cyberspace domain has not been an easy one for established organizations and institutions. The battlefield, in which now speed and stealth instead of size and budget are the determining factors that provide an edge have not well for many, especially those in the military. Now they do not clearly dictate who amongst combatants have the ‘upper hand' and represent a significant paradigm shift from factors that were very good predictors of a potential outcome of military conflicts. The battles of the past were largely over territories and resources (Landscape Metrics, 2015). We see outcomes now being influenced by a broader range of factors, including politics, culture, economy, religion, and ethnicity. These new ‘pivot points' for conflict require a very different understanding and approach to achieve desired outcomes. Technology continues to be the main enabler that has transformed the battlefield and the rules of engagement from the conventional domains to cyberspace. The issue of attribution has been a huge differentiator and looms very large in cyberspace conflicts because it is very difficult to determine within a sufficient timeframe the source of an attack and to be able to respond to or prevent attacks. Now conflicts have expanded in such a way that combatants now cross all prospective levels of society from targets to attackers or perpetrators. The low cost required to provide significant damage to a desired target environment in cyberspace has been a game changer. As a result, the rules of engagement which were much clearer in conventional domains on military fronts are much more blurred due to the new realm of combatants, and as such, has changed many of the approaches and methodologies that were standard practices in traditional campaigns. In this paper, we focus on cyber conflicts and how the cultural differences of these three communities have plagued the ability to achieve a simple and coherent response against attackers and perpetrators. We pursue the relevance of trust and deterrence and their influence on ‘warfare' tactics in the cyberspace domain. We also look at culture and the ‘new norm' and how they have required consideration of new and unconventional approaches. We see how data can better inform decision makers and those responsible for designing and implementing campaigns in this new era of conflict. Our results indicate the need for a different model to work through the differences in culture if better are to be obtained by the combatants.

pub.1120374058,10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.013.379,Nuclear Arms Control in US Foreign Policy,"The development of military arms harnessing nuclear energy for mass destruction has inspired continual efforts to control them. Since 1945, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Israel, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and South Africa acquired control over these powerful weapons, though Pretoria dismantled its small cache in 1989 and Russia inherited the Soviet arsenal in 1996. Throughout this period, Washington sought to limit its nuclear forces in tandem with those of Moscow, prevent new states from fielding them, discourage their military use, and even permit their eventual abolition. Scholars disagree about what explains the United States’ distinct approach to nuclear arms control. The history of U.S. nuclear policy treats intellectual theories and cultural attitudes alongside technical advances and strategic implications. The central debate is one of structure versus agency: whether the weapons’ sheer power, or historical actors’ attitudes toward that power, drove nuclear arms control. Among those who emphasize political responsibility, there are two further disagreements: (1) the relative influence of domestic protest, culture, and politics; and (2) whether U.S. nuclear arms control aimed first at securing the peace by regulating global nuclear forces or at bolstering American influence in the world. The intensity of nuclear arms control efforts tended to rise or fall with the likelihood of nuclear war. Harry Truman’s faith in the country’s monopoly on nuclear weapons caused him to sabotage early initiatives, while Dwight Eisenhower’s belief in nuclear deterrence led in a similar direction. Fears of a U.S.-Soviet thermonuclear exchange mounted in the late 1950s, stoked by atmospheric nuclear testing and widespread radioactive fallout, which stirred protest movements and diplomatic initiatives. The spread of nuclear weapons to new states motivated U.S. presidents (John Kennedy in the vanguard) to mount a concerted campaign against “proliferation,” climaxing with the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Richard Nixon was exceptional. His reasons for signing the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) and Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) with Moscow in 1972 were strategic: to buttress the country’s geopolitical position as U.S. armed forces withdrew from Southeast Asia. The rise of protest movements and Soviet economic difficulties after Ronald Reagan entered the Oval Office brought about two more landmark U.S.-Soviet accords—the 1987 Intermediate Ballistic Missile Treaty (INF) and the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)—the first occasions on which the superpowers eliminated nuclear weapons through treaty. The country’s attention swung to proliferation after the Soviet collapse in December 1991, as failed states, regional disputes, and non-state actors grew more prominent. Although controversies over Iraq, North Korea, and Iran’s nuclear programs have since erupted, Washington and Moscow continued to reduce their arsenals and refine their nuclear doctrines even as President Barack Obama proclaimed his support for a nuclear-free world.",Oxford Research Encyclopedia of American History,2017,,,,"Hunt, Jonathan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120374058,0,

We propose that the project of building a nuclear-propelled submarine has become possible partly because of the mobilisation of a set of arguments for the construction of the South Atlantic as a strategic area, framed in terms of security and development. On the other hand, we contend that the need for a nuclear-propelled submarine is framed through the mobilisation of a specific notion of deterrence. In other words, we claim that the notions of ‘strategic area’, ‘general deterrence’, ‘conventional deterrence’, and ‘deterrence by denial’ can help us analyse the fundamental aspects involved in the framing of the South Atlantic as a security concern, justifying the nuclear-propelled submarine project.",Contexto Internacional,2017,39,AHEAD,0-0,"Herz, Mônica; Dawood, Layla; Lage, Victor Coutinho",Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro; Rio de Janeiro State University,Brazil; Brazil,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085456694,2,"[Bigo, Didier]|[]|Alternatives Global Local Political|2002|27|1_suppl|63-92|10.1177/03043754020270s105|pub.1016056218|980;[Abdenur, Adriana Erthal; de Souza Neto, Danilo Marcondes]|[ur.016376643067.61; ur.016121326747.51]|Journal of the Indian Ocean Region|2014|10|1|1-17|10.1080/19480881.2014.896103|pub.1022987816|4;[da Silva, Alexandre Pereira]|[ur.012245310051.17]|Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional|2013|56|1|104-121|10.1590/s0034-73292013000100006|pub.1027578163|6;[Filho, João Roberto Martins]|[ur.01203702247.39]|Contexto Internacional|2011|33|2|277-314|10.1590/s0102-85292011000200002|pub.1041342069|6;[de Sá, Andrea]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|2015|22|1|3-25|10.1080/10736700.2015.1070044|pub.1052901966|2;[Achen, Christopher H.; Snidal, Duncan]|[; ur.010273021353.18]|World Politics|1989|41|2|143-169|10.2307/2010405|pub.1053727425|188;[Neumann, Iver B.]|[ur.01340020743.37]|Review of International Studies|1994|20|1|53-74|10.1017/s0260210500117784|pub.1053839891|88;[Acharya, Amitav]|[ur.013614104542.61]|World Politics|2007|59|4|629-652|10.1353/wp.2008.0000|pub.1065052985|91"
pub.1085451890,10.4324/9781315208107,US Strategic Arms Policy in the Cold War,"This book examines the negotiations between the USA and the USSR on the limitation of strategic arms during the Cold War, from 1969 to 1979. The negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms, which were concluded in two agreements SALT I and SALT II (with only the first ratified), marked a major change in the history of arms control negotiations. For the first time, in the relatively short history of nuclear weapons and negotiations over nuclear disarmament, the two major nuclear powers had agreed to put limits on the size of their nuclear strategic arms. However, the negotiations between the US and USSR were the easy part of the process. The more difficult part was the negotiations among the Americans. Through the study of a decade of negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms in the Cold War, this book examines the forces that either allowed US presidents and senior officials to pave a path toward a US arms limitation policy, or prevented them from doing so. Most importantly, the book discusses the meaning of these negotiations and agreements on the limitation of strategic arms, and seeks to identify the intention of the negotiators: Were they aiming at making the world a safer place? What was the purpose of the negotiations and agreements within US strategic thinking, both militarily and diplomatically? Were they aimed at improving relations with the Soviet Union, or only at enhancing the strategic balance as one component of the strategic nuclear deterrence between the two powers? This book will be of much interest to students of Cold War history, arms control, US foreign policy and international relations in general. Introduction 1. SALT: The New Era: Nixon’s Years 2.

pub.1086392269,10.18356/c338cd44-en,Delegitimising nuclear violence,"Reducing and eventually eliminating the risk of nuclear violence remains a challenging task. Currently, countries that possess nuclear weapons and those to whom the United States has extended its nuclear protection in the form of security commitments see considerable value in the long-term retention and deployment of nuclear weapons. The value of nuclear weapons is framed primarily in terms of security through the practice of nuclear deterrence. Deterrence rests on the possibility of catastrophic harm through nuclear violence and inducement of a sufficient level of caution into State interactions through fear of such a possibility as to preclude serious war and thereby stabilise relations between the major powers.",Civil Society and Disarmament,2017,,,47-62,"Ritchie, Nick",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1086392269,0,
pub.1085062036,10.1162/isec_a_00273,The New Era of Counterforce: Technological Change and the Future of Nuclear Deterrence,"Nuclear deterrence rests on the survivability of nuclear arsenals. For much of the nuclear age, “counterforce” disarming attacks—those aimed at eliminating an opponent's nuclear forces—were nearly impossible because of the ability of potential victims to hide and protect their weapons. Technological developments, however, are eroding this foundation of nuclear deterrence. Advances rooted in the computer revolution have made nuclear forces around the world considerably more vulnerable. Specifically, two key approaches that countries have relied on to ensure arsenal survivability since the dawn of the nuclear age—hardening and concealment—have been undercut by leaps in weapons accuracy and a revolution in remote sensing. Various methods, evidence, and models demonstrate the emergence of new possibilities for counterforce disarming strikes. In short, the task of securing nuclear arsenals against attack is far more difficult than it was in the past. The new era of counterforce challenges the basis for confidence in contemporary deterrence stability, raises critical issues for national and international security policy, and sheds light on one of the enduring theoretical puzzles of the nuclear era: why international security competition has endured in the shadow of the nuclear revolution.",International Security,2017,41,4,9-49,"Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1085062036,43,"[Glaser, Charles L.; Fetter, Steve]|[ur.015171401702.20; ur.010107403101.87]|International Security|2016|41|1|49-98|10.1162/isec_a_00248|pub.1001430062|18;[Kristensen, Hans M.]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|2007|14|2|373-390|10.1080/10736700701379484|pub.1008008499|2;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|International Security|2013|38|1|80-104|10.1162/isec_a_00127|pub.1014370472|16;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[; ]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2015|71|3|84-97|10.1177/0096340215581363|pub.1018775977|6;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|International Security|2006|30|4|7-44|10.1162/isec.2006.30.4.7|pub.1025314466|62;[RIQIANG, WU]|[ur.011715614673.52]|Science & Global Security|2011|19|2|91-120|10.1080/08929882.2011.586312|pub.1025560086|8;[Arkin, William M.]|[ur.016126056147.45]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1996|52|6|68-68|10.1080/00963402.1996.11456682|pub.1036326208|3;[Riqiang, Wu]|[ur.011715614673.52]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2013|36|4|579-614|10.1080/01402390.2013.772510|pub.1038131641|8;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[ur.011142131155.38; ur.012535072155.07]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2015|71|5|77-83|10.1177/0096340215599788|pub.1042584654|5;[Holmes, James R.]|[]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2016|72|4|1-6|10.1080/00963402.2016.1194060|pub.1045693960|6;[Kristensen, Hans M.; Norris, Robert S.]|[; ]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2014|70|6|97-115|10.1177/0096340214555409|pub.1046391352|6;[Fischer, Benjamin B.]|[]|International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence|2014|27|3|431-464|10.1080/08850607.2014.900290|pub.1048332907|9;[BIN, LI]|[]|Science & Global Security|2007|15|1|1-30|10.1080/08929880701350197|pub.1049835643|8;[Feiveson, Harold; von Hippel, Frank]|[ur.012367154724.16; ur.0604600515.21]|Physics Today|1983|36|1|36-49|10.1063/1.2915443|pub.1057883337|5;[Perry, R.P.; DiPietro, R.C.; Fante, R.L.]|[ur.013450325515.08; ur.011264102557.92; ur.010401123647.46]|IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems|1999|35|1|188-200|10.1109/7.745691|pub.1061215374|489;[Rousseau, Louis-Philippe; Gierull, Christoph; Chouinard, Jean-Yves]|[ur.016135344203.57; ur.011041716457.02; ur.011514555443.65]|IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing|2015|8|11|5068-5080|10.1109/jstars.2015.2432736|pub.1061333793|15;[Baumgartner, Stefan V.; Krieger, Gerhard]|[ur.015214533003.95; ur.07447032053.55]|IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing|2015|8|11|5015-5029|10.1109/jstars.2015.2450019|pub.1061333862|31;[Gierull, Christoph H.; Sikaneta, Ishuwa; Cerutti-Maori, Delphine]|[ur.011041716457.02; ur.011376632161.35; ur.015221472465.46]|IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing|2013|51|1|436-454|10.1109/tgrs.2012.2201729|pub.1061612414|76;[Waltz, Kenneth N.]|[ur.07672317363.47]|American Political Science Review|1990|84|3|730-745|10.2307/1962764|pub.1069669481|129;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|1979|94|4|617|10.2307/2149629|pub.1069789637|35;[Steinbruner, John D.; Garwin, Thomas M.]|[; ur.012501473735.43]|International Security|1976|1|1|138|10.2307/2538581|pub.1069980279|20;[Daugherty, William; Levi, Barbara; Hippel, Frank Von]|[ur.010753572153.22; ur.01120160605.19; ur.0714423774.03]|International Security|1986|10|4|3|10.2307/2538949|pub.1069980581|23;[Waltz, Kenneth N.]|[]|International Security|1993|18|2|44|10.2307/2539097|pub.1069980686|492;[Talmadge, Caitlin]|[ur.010651115301.94]|International Security|2017|41|4|50-92|10.1162/isec_a_00274|pub.1085066615|18;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|Foreign Affairs|2006|85|2|42|10.2307/20031910|pub.1102750588|30;[Keeny, Spurgeon M.; Panofsky, Wolfgang K.

pub.1083827234,10.1093/cybsec/tyw017,Thermonuclear cyberwar,"Nuclear command and control increasingly relies on computing networks that might be vulnerable to cyber attack. Yet nuclear deterrence and cyber operations have quite different political properties. For the most part, nuclear actors can openly advertise their weapons to signal the costs of aggression to potential adversaries, thereby reducing the danger of misperception and war. Cyber actors, in contrast, must typically hide their capabilities, as revelation allows adversaries to patch, reconfigure, or otherwise neutralize the threat. Offensive cyber operations are better used than threatened, while the opposite, fortunately, is true for nuclear weapons. When combined, the warfighting advantages of cyber operations become dangerous liabilities for nuclear deterrence. Increased uncertainty about the nuclear/cyber balance of power raises the risk of miscalculation during a brinksmanship crisis. We should expect strategic stability in nuclear dyads to be, in part, a function of relative offensive and defensive cyber capacity.

pub.1083417688,10.1007/s13347-017-0252-8,Warfighting for Cyber Deterrence: a Strategic and Moral Imperative,"Theories of cyber deterrence are developing rapidly. However, the literature is missing an important ingredient—warfighting for deterrence. This controversial idea, most commonly associated with nuclear strategy during the later stages of the Cold War, affords a number of advantages. It provides enhanced credibility for deterrence, offers means to deal with deterrence failure (including intrawar deterrence and damage limitation), improves compliance with the requirements of just war and ultimately ensures that strategy continues to function in the post-deterrence environment. This paper assesses whether a warfighting for deterrence approach is suitable for the cyber domain. In doing so, it challenges the notion that warfighting concepts are unsuitable for operations in cyberspace. To do this, the work constructs a conceptual framework that is then applied to cyber deterrence. It is found that all of the advantages of taking a warfighting stance apply to cyber operations. The paper concludes by constructing a warfighting model for cyber deterrence. This model includes passive and active defences and cross-domain offensive capabilities. The central message of the paper is that a theory of victory (strategy) must guide the development of cyber deterrence.",Philosophy & Technology,2017,31,3,1-21,"Lonsdale, David J.",University of Hull,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083417688,3,"[Lonsdale, David J]|[]|The RUSI Journal|2016|161|4|52-62|10.1080/03071847.2016.1232880|pub.1002151960|4;[Lonsdale, David J.]|[]|Defence Studies|2007|7|1|42-64|10.1080/14702430601135578|pub.1003601451|4;[Stevens, Tim]|[ur.012032636047.62]|Contemporary Security Policy|2012|33|1|148-170|10.1080/13523260.2012.659597|pub.1010718194|24;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]||1989||||10.1007/978-1-349-20165-5|pub.1019965352|67;[Dipert, Randall R.]|[ur.013663237163.53]|Journal of Military Ethics|2010|9|4|384-410|10.1080/15027570.2010.536404|pub.1027720553|52;[Eberle, Christopher J.]|[]|Journal of Military Ethics|2013|12|1|54-67|10.1080/15027570.2013.782638|pub.1030375395|14;[Farwell, James P.; Rohozinski, Rafal]|[ur.012517747437.29; ur.016353662501.84]|Survival|2011|53|1|23-40|10.1080/00396338.2011.555586|pub.1032711969|309;[Rid, Thomas; Buchanan, Ben]|[ur.010444241522.28; ur.013432143522.19]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2015|38|1-2|4-37|10.1080/01402390.2014.977382|pub.1035532991|130;[Harknett, Richard J.; Callaghan, John P.; Kauffman, Rudi]|[ur.013103074544.06; ; ]|Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management|2010|7|1||10.2202/1547-7355.1636|pub.1038674265|16;[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[ur.016123225213.98]|Journal of Cybersecurity|2015|1|1|53-67|10.1093/cybsec/tyv003|pub.1039177182|34;[Gray, Colin S.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1984|7|1|5-28|10.1080/01402398408437174|pub.1045189616|7;[Stone, John]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2012|33|1|108-123|10.1080/13523260.2012.659591|pub.1048446602|7;[Barrett, Edward T.]|[]|Journal of Military Ethics|2013|12|1|4-17|10.1080/15027570.2013.782633|pub.1048758005|25;[Knopf, Jeffrey W.]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2010|31|1|1-33|10.1080/13523261003640819|pub.1053308175|47;[Iasiello, Emilio]|[]|Journal of Strategic Security|2014|7|1|54-67|10.5038/1944-0472.7.1.5|pub.1072564829|13;[Dipert, Randall R.]|[ur.013663237163.53]|Binary Bullets|2016|||56-72|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190221072.003.0004|pub.1089055486|5;[Jenkins, Ryan]|[]|Binary Bullets|2016|||89-114|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190221072.003.0006|pub.1089055488|3;[Beard, Matthew]|[]|Binary Bullets|2016|||139-156|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190221072.003.0008|pub.1089055490|1;[Canetti, Daphna; Gross, Michael L.; Waismel-Manor, Israel]|[ur.0733253457.21; ur.01061352134.59; ur.01162215454.41]|Binary Bullets|2016|||157-176|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190221072.003.0009|pub.1089055491|6;[Miller, Seumas]|[]|Binary Bullets|2016|||228-250|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190221072.003.0012|pub.1089055494|2;[Pollpeter, Kevin]|[]|China and Cybersecurity|2015|||138-162|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190201265.003.0006|pub.1089094794|5;[Gerson, Michael S.]|[]||2009||||10.21236/ada510428|pub.1091542447|6;[Valeriano, Brandon; Maness, Ryan C.]|[ur.013636643561.19; ur.013041263161.39]||2015||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190204792.001.0001|pub.1098742471|77;[Gray, Colin S.; Payne, Keith]|[; ]|Foreign Policy|1980||39|14|10.2307/1148409|pub.1102456793|58;[Wieseltier, Leon]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1985|63|4|827|10.2307/20042288|pub.1102754991|14;[Wohlstetter, Albert]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1959|37|2|211|10.2307/20029345|pub.1102763664|138;[]|[]||2013||||10.1017/cbo9781139169288|pub.1108525108|136;[]|[]||2015||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190201265.001.0001|pub.1108581018|18"
pub.1074232684,10.1007/s13347-016-0251-1,Five Kinds of Cyber Deterrence,"There were five kinds of cyber deterrence presented at the workshop on Landscaping strategic cyber deterrence, hosted at the Oxford Internet Institute. They were the well-studied areas of deterrence by ‘punishment’ and ‘denial’, and the novel concepts of deterrence by ‘association’, ‘norms and taboos’, and finally, ‘entanglement’. In the following workshop commentary, I present these five kinds of deterrence and explain them in light of recent developments in the academy and industry. I argue for analytical congruence between all three novel concepts, since they aim to alter the behaviour of actors by adding a social cost in response to breaking norms and conventions. Throughout, I argue that we are beginning to understand how cyber deterrence works, both in theory and practice, and when all concepts are taken together, they become more than the sum of their parts. Finally, I point out an omission of the workshop, where computational modelling and simulation could be added to the landscape of strategic cyber deterrence.",Philosophy & Technology,2017,31,3,1-8,"Ryan, N.

The cornerstone of the analysis is an existing paradox – although the US is thought to be the country that maintains the norm of non-usage of nuclear weapons, in practice, the US forms the strategy based on nuclear deterrence. In order to implement the main aim of this article, theories of the norm of nuclear weapon non-usage and deterrence were taken into consideration. There are two main parts of this article. Theories that were chosen for the analysis are discussed at the first part of the article. The second part is aimed to find out how the norm of non-usage and nuclear deterrence interacts in practice. The case of the US is analyzed in terms of qualitative content analysis. The statements and remarks of high-ranking US politicians and military officers, official documents and treaties were the main empirical data of the analysis. An analysis of the theories delivered the conclusion that despite certain principal differences, the theoretical combinations of the norm of non-usage and nuclear deterrence are still possible because of the same aim. Both seek the nuclear weapon not be used again. Moreover, the use of both approaches in the same case study helps to get a broader look and see some specifics at the same time. The empirical analysis has shown that the meaning of nuclear deterrence was reconsidered in case of the US. One of the main reasons of reconsideration was the new nuclear doctrine (“Nuclear posture review”), delivered by B. Obama in 2010. According to the new doctrine, the US have to promote disarmament and maintain effective nuclear deterrence at the same time. The psychological elements of this strategy were emphasized in the narrative of new deterrence creation, meanwhile the material ones being relegated to the background. In addition, the form of the nuclear weapon non-usage was transformed into a tradition of non-usage because of the process of dynamics. The tradition of non-usage leaves a small chance of a nuclear weapon usage possibility, which is the necessary condition for the deterrence. From a theoretical point of view, it solves the paradox of norms and deterrence. However, the combination of these concepts seems to be unnatural in practice and it has a negative effect on the implementation of credible deterrence. The not clearly defined nuclear posture of the US may cost the bringing of certain tensions in the future. It can encourage enemies to proliferate a nuclear arsenal or even use it.",Politologija,2017,84,4,3-53,"Bladaitė, Neringa",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1087146581,0,
pub.1043790975,10.1080/01402390.2015.1115975,‘Cumulative Deterrence’ as a New Paradigm for Cyber Deterrence,"This article suggests that there is a paradigm crisis in the sub-field of cyber deterrence. Cyber deterrence is evolving slowly and unpromisingly as a strategic tool in both theory and practice, mostly due to the ill-fitting theoretical framework and underlining assumptions it borrows from the absolute-nuclear-deterrence context. Therefore, this article suggests replacing the accepted yet inadequate paradigm of absolute deterrence with a better-fitting restrictive-cumulative-deterrence paradigm that draws on the Israeli approach to deterrence, introducing it into the cyber domain. The article further criticizes the current discourse in the field, including some ‘common knowledge’ (mis)understandings of cyberspace and the ways it affects the possibility of deterrence.",Journal of Strategic Studies,2017,40,1-2,1-26,"Tor, Uri",Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya,Israel,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043790975,15,"[Malka, Amos]|[]|Comparative Strategy|2008|27|1|1-19|10.1080/01495930701839613|pub.1004426452|4;[Rid, Thomas; McBurney, Peter]|[; ur.012061366407.93]|The RUSI Journal|2012|157|1|6-13|10.1080/03071847.2012.664354|pub.1007150375|49;[Stevens, Tim]|[ur.012032636047.62]|Contemporary Security Policy|2012|33|1|148-170|10.1080/13523260.2012.659597|pub.1010718194|24;[Manson, George Patterson]|[]|Comparative Strategy|2011|30|2|121-133|10.1080/01495933.2011.561730|pub.1013177363|7;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2012|33|1|85-107|10.1080/13523260.2012.659589|pub.1015704833|28;[Adamsky, Dmitry Dima]|[ur.010555073357.43]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2013|36|1|4-41|10.1080/01402390.2012.732015|pub.1018863836|9;[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[]|Security Studies|2013|22|3|365-404|10.1080/09636412.2013.816122|pub.1025246311|117;[Atzili, Boaz; Pearlman, Wendy]|[ur.07527402153.02; ur.011336244375.14]|Security Studies|2012|21|2|301-335|10.1080/09636412.2012.679209|pub.1025517105|10;[McGraw, Gary]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2013|36|1|109-119|10.1080/01402390.2012.742013|pub.1029347102|33;[Farwell, James P.; Rohozinski, Rafal]|[ur.012517747437.29; ur.016353662501.84]|Survival|2011|53|1|23-40|10.1080/00396338.2011.555586|pub.1032711969|309;[Rid, Thomas]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2013|36|1|139-142|10.1080/01402390.2012.742012|pub.1033907465|8;[Rid, Thomas; Buchanan, Ben]|[ur.010444241522.28; ur.013432143522.19]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2015|38|1-2|4-37|10.1080/01402390.2014.977382|pub.1035532991|130;[Rid, Thomas]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2012|33|1|124-147|10.1080/13523260.2012.659593|pub.1045901588|18;[Henriksen, Dag]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|1|95-120|10.1080/01402390.2011.601095|pub.1053100569|7;[Knopf, Jeffrey W.]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2010|31|1|1-33|10.1080/13523261003640819|pub.1053308175|47;[Paul, T.

Such cooperation is often analyzed through the prism of “extended nuclear deterrence,” which focuses on the extension of U.S. security guarantees and their effect on potential adversaries. This article argues that this underplays the importance of institutional factors: Allies have historically addressed a range of objectives through such cooperation, which has helped to catalyze agreements about broader alliance strategy. The varied form such cooperation takes in different alliances also flows from the respective bargaining power of allies and the relative importance of consensus, rather than perceived threats.

pub.1048631847,10.13182/nt16-76,Experimental and Computational Forensics Characterization of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Produced in a Fast Reactor Neutron Environment,"A terrorist attack using an improvised nuclear device is one of the most serious dangers facing the United States. The work presented here is part of an effort to improve nuclear deterrence by developing a methodology to attribute weapons-grade plutonium to a source reactor by measuring the intrinsic physical characteristics of the interdicted plutonium. In order to demonstrate the developed methodology, plutonium samples were produced from depleted uranium dioxide (DUO2) surrogates irradiated in a fast-neutron environment. In order to replicate the neutron flux in a fast-neutron-spectrum reactor and obtain experimental samples emulating weapons-grade plutonium produced in the blanket of a fast breeder reactor, DUO2 samples were placed in a gadolinium sheath and irradiated in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Previous computational work on this topic identified several fission products that could be used to distinguish between reactor types (fast and thermal reactors), specifically: 137Cs, 134Cs, 154Eu, 125Sb, 144Ce, 85Rb, 147Pm, and 150Sm along with the plutonium isotopes. Simulations of the fast neutron irradiation of the DUO2 fuel surrogates in the HFIR were carried out using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNPX 2.7. Comparisons of the predicted values of plutonium and fission product concentrations to destructive and nondestructive assay measurements of neutron-irradiated DUO2 surrogates are presented here. The agreement between the predictions and gamma spectroscopic measurements in general were within 10% for 134Cs, 137Cs, 154Eu, and 144Ce. Additional experimental results (mass spectroscopy) agreed to within 5% for the following isotopes: 85Rb, 147Pm, 150Sm, 154Eu, 148Nd, 144Ce, and 239Pu. Two indicator isotopes previously suggested to differentiate between the reactor types were ruled out for use in the attribution methodology; 125Sb was ruled out due to the difficulty in accurately predicting its concentration, and 242Pu was ruled out because of its low content in weapons-grade plutonium.",Nuclear Technology,2017,197,1,1-11,"Swinney, Mathew W.; Folden, Charles M.; Ellis, Ronald J.; Chirayath, Sunil S.",Texas A&M University; Oak Ridge National Laboratory,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048631847,6,"[Chirayath, Sunil Sunny; Hollenbeck, Gordon; Ragusa, Jean; Nelson, Paul]|[ur.014230135501.60; ; ur.012567726063.20; ]|Nuclear Engineering and Design|2009|239|10|1916-1924|10.1016/j.nucengdes.2009.05.019|pub.1011010615|7;[Chetal, S.C.; Balasubramaniyan, V.; Chellapandi, P.; Mohanakrishnan, P.; Puthiyavinayagam, P.; Pillai, C.P.; Raghupathy, S.; Shanmugham, T.K.; Pillai, C.

pub.1083410445,10.1162/isec_a_00266,Deterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,"Understanding deterrence and dissuasion in cyberspace is often difficult because our minds are captured by Cold War images of massive retaliation to a nuclear attack by nuclear means. The analogy to nuclear deterrence is misleading, however, because many aspects of cyber behavior are more like other behaviors, such as crime, that states try (imperfectly) to deter. Preventing harm in cyberspace involves four complex mechanisms: threats of punishment, denial, entanglement, and norms. Even when punishment is used, deterrent threats need not be limited to cyber responses, and they may address general behavior as well as specific acts. Cyber threats are plentiful, often ambiguous, and difficult to attribute. Problems of attribution are said to limit deterrence and dissuasion in the cyber domain, but three of the major means—denial by defense, entanglement, and normative taboos—are not strongly hindered by the attribution problem. The effectiveness of different mechanisms depends on context, and the question of whether deterrence works in cyberspace depends on “who and what.” Not all cyberattacks are of equal importance; not all can be deterred; and not all rise to the level of significant national security threats. The lesson for policymakers is to focus on the most important attacks and to understand the context in which such attacks may occur and the full range of mechanisms available to prevent them.",International Security,2017,41,3,44-71,"Nye, Joseph S.",Harvard University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083410445,52,"[Naughton, John]|[]|Journal of Cyber Policy|2016|1|1|5-28|10.1080/23738871.2016.1157619|pub.1005318203|27;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1979|31|2|289-324|10.2307/2009945|pub.1013991718|128;[Lieber, Keir A.; Press, Daryl G.]|[ur.011242775623.03; ur.010130626705.72]|International Security|2013|38|1|80-104|10.1162/isec_a_00127|pub.1014370472|16;[BETTS, RICHARD K.]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|2002|117|1|19-36|10.2307/798092|pub.1019254023|35;[Rid, Thomas; Buchanan, Ben]|[ur.010444241522.28; ur.013432143522.19]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2015|38|1-2|4-37|10.1080/01402390.2014.977382|pub.1035532991|130;[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[ur.016123225213.98]|Journal of Cybersecurity|2015|1|1|53-67|10.1093/cybsec/tyv003|pub.1039177182|34;[Long, Franklin A.]|[]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1984|40|5|50-54|10.1080/00963402.1984.11459230|pub.1042467018|3;[Tannenwald, Nina]|[]|International Security|2005|29|4|5-49|10.1162/isec.2005.29.4.5|pub.1051701552|57;[Nye, Joseph S.]|[ur.015062046025.69]|International Organization|1987|41|3|371-402|10.1017/s0020818300027521|pub.1052924039|155;[Finnemore, Martha; Sikkink, Kathryn]|[ur.011147545123.36; ur.01130215234.53]|International Organization|1998|52|4|887-917|10.1162/002081898550789|pub.1063348721|2846;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|International Security|1982|7|3|3|10.2307/2538549|pub.1069980249|70"
pub.1092486925,10.2139/ssrn.3052231,The Logic of Latent Nuclear Deterrence,"Nuclear deterrence is central to international relations theory and practice. Most people assume that countries must possess nuclear weapons in order to reap deterrence benefits from their nuclear programs. Nuclear deterrence without bombs is seemingly impossible, since countries would be unable to immediately retaliate with nuclear forces. This article shows, however, that latent nuclear powers – nonnuclear states that possess the capacity to make weapons – can deter aggression, despite their lack of assembled warheads. Latent nuclear deterrence works because states that possess the technology needed to produce bombs can threaten to initiate or accelerate nuclear weapons programs if they are attacked. The evidence reveals that latent nuclear deterrence is surprisingly effective: countries such as Egypt, Iran, and Japan have been able to reduce their vulnerability to violent conflict simply by developing sensitive dual-use nuclear technology. Nuclear arsenals may be sufficient for nuclear deterrence to operate – but they are not necessary. This carries lessons for the debate about nuclear disarmament: most scholars and policymakers are skeptical that the prospect of nuclear rearmament in a disarmed world could deter serious international disputes, but the case for latent nuclear deterrence is stronger than critics would lead us to believe.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2017,,,,"Fuhrmann, Matthew",Texas A&M University System,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092486925,1,

In less than one term in power, as the ‘core leader’ of the second world largest economy Xi Jinping has managed to reshape China’s image and behaviour at home and abroad. He has reinterpreted the relation with the superpower United States through what he called a ‘New Model of Major-Country Relations’. He promoted the so-called ‘China Dream’, a concept calling for the ‘rejuvenation’ of the Chinese nation. Xi Jinping, through the complex bureaucratic machine of China’s state apparatus, was able to unify political elites and party officials, together with some major public intellectuals and academics to marry and support the project expected to return China to the kind glory and grandeur the country enjoyed since the Roman Empire: the ‘New Silk Road’, better known as the ‘One Belt One Road’ (OBOR) initiative. However, even though support of Chinese ideational narratives has grown vis-à-vis the more significant role China plays at the international level, serious gaps persist as regards to how the People’s Republic of China (PRC) practically conducts its foreign policy in terms of international rules and standards already set by other countries. In fact, with regards to specific issues and areas such as climate change, nuclear deterrence or cyber-security, leaders in Beijing are still struggling to reach a comprehensive understanding in line with the ideas and policies supported by the majority of countries in the West. As a consequence, this chapter concludes that only combing Chinese ideational narratives of world order with a practical understanding of how such policies are discussed at the international level, will allow China to play a growing role in the realm of global governance.",Understanding China,2017,,,175-185,"Menegazzi, Silvia",Guido Carli Free International University for Social Studies,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1086147382,0,"[ZENG, JINGHAN; BRESLIN, SHAUN]|[ur.010030672507.62; ur.014574745207.88]|International Affairs|2016|92|4|773-794|10.1111/1468-2346.12656|pub.1012726834|35;[Hao, Qi]|[]|The Chinese Journal of International Politics|2015|8|4|349-370|10.1093/cjip/pov012|pub.1023315988|10;[Berkofsky, Axel]|[ur.014512737627.77]|Asia-Pacific Review|2016|23|2|109-128|10.1080/13439006.2016.1244963|pub.1031933458|1;[FERDINAND, PETER]|[]|International Affairs|2016|92|4|941-957|10.1111/1468-2346.12660|pub.1032770266|184;[Johnston, Alastair Iain]|[ur.012057106077.76]|International Security|2013|37|4|7-48|10.1162/isec_a_00115|pub.1045353858|175;[Callahan, William A]|[ur.016161752127.22]|Asian Journal of Comparative Politics|2016|1|3|226-243|10.1177/2057891116647806|pub.1064085490|99;[Sørensen, Camilla T.N.]|[ur.015736500435.85]|Journal of China and International Relations|2015|3|1||10.5278/ojs.jcir.v3i1.1146|pub.1110198883|12"

This reflects the overall argument that discourse analyses aiming to represent diversity of social context will necessarily approach the task selectively, since all dimensions are of potential relevance to any and every communicative manifestation.

pub.1095661336,10.1109/cyconus.2016.7836619,Cyber Deterrence in Times of Cyber Anarchy,"The advent of the cyber domain has introduced a new dimension into warfare and complicated existing strategic concepts, provoking divergent responses within different national contexts and strategic cultures. Although current theories regarding cyber deterrence remain relatively nascent, a comparison of U.S. and Chinese strategic thinking highlights notable asymmetries between their respective approaches. While U.S. debates on cyber deterrence have primarily focused on the deterrence of cyber threats, Chinese theorists have also emphasized the potential importance of cyber capabilities to enhance strategic deterrence. Whereas the U.S. government has maintained a consistent declaratory policy for response, Beijing has yet to progress toward transparency regarding its cyber strategy or capabilities. However, certain PLA strategists, informed by a conceptualization of deterrence as integrated with war-fighting, have advocated for the actualization of deterrence through engaging in cyber attacks. Regardless of whether these major cyber powers' evolving strategic thinking on cyber deterrence will prove logically consistent or feasibly operational, their respective perspectives will certainly shape their attempts to achieve cyber deterrence. Ultimately, cyber deterrence may continue to be “what states make of it,” given conditions of “cyber anarchy” and prevailing uncertainties regarding cyber conflict. iiThis phrasing is adapted from: Alexander Wendt, “Anarchy is what states make of it: the social construction of power politics,” International Organization 46, no. 02 (1992): 391–425.

Deterrence of nuclear terrorism is therefore different from deterrence against states. South Asia is more vulnerable to nuclear terrorism than any other region of the world for many reasons.

pub.1093808659,10.1109/cyconus.2016.7836610,Suggestions to measure cyber power and proposed metrics for cyber warfare operations (cyberdeterrence/cyber power),"How does one measure cyber power? Though there are many established methods for measuring power, none of these can be satisfactorily applied to the cyber domain, and these shortcomings were recognized two decades ago. ""Traditional measures of military force, gross national product, population, energy, land, and minerals have continued to dominate discussions of the balance of power. These power resources still matter, and American leadership continues to depend on them as well as on the information edge... Information power is also hard to categorize because it cuts across all other military, economic, social, and political power resources, in some cases diminishing their strength, in others multiplying it "". (Nye and Owens, 1996, p.22). The author is also trying to determine the metrics of cyber operations, ie how does one measure success? The ability to measure and validate success is always a crucial metric in the performance of a task, and in this case the conduct of an Information Warfare (IW) campaigns is no different. This research analyses two approaches for the development of metrics in a Cyber environment: · A top-down approach with a strong feedback mechanism, one that allows actors to learn lessons from their actions and to apply changes to the system as deemed appropriate. · A more decentralised methodology, which embraced any and all IW standards. This bottom-up view utilises a more liberal process for collecting metrics that attempts to bring together disparate activities into a collective force. This paper will analyse the efforts of various IW initiatives by both sides, and attempt to determine the key factors of success.",2016 International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon U.S.),2016,,,1-7,"Armistead, Edwin L.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093808659,1,"[Russett, Bruce]|[]|American Political Science Review|1990|84|4|1400-1401|10.2307/1963315|pub.1069670022|53;[Campbell, Tony; Armistead, Leigh]|[; ]|International Journal Canada's Journal of Global Policy Analysis|2005|60|3|868|10.2307/40204074|pub.1070533637|13;[Ronfeldt, David; Arquilla, John]|[ur.013665643773.40; ur.015662377347.72]|First Monday|2007||||10.5210/fm.v12i8.1971|pub.1072709471|6;[]|[]|Choice|1997|35|02|35-1145a-35-1145a|10.5860/choice.35-1145a|pub.1073346390|30;[Tempestilli, Mark]|[]||1995||||10.21236/ada297843|pub.1091568661|1;[]|[]||1990||||10.21236/ada386009|pub.1091577501|3;[Kuehl, Dan]|[]||1997||||10.21236/ada394366|pub.1091605594|7;[Cohen, Eliot A.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1996|75|2|37|10.2307/20047487|pub.1102760806|79;[Keohane, Robert O.; Nye, Joseph S.]|[; ]|Foreign Affairs|1998|77|5|81|10.2307/20049052|pub.1102762093|198"
pub.1095436062,10.1109/cyconus.2016.7836629,Disruptive Innovations to Help Protect Against Future Threats,"Innovation is back in vogue within the U.S. military. In the face of defense spending cuts and reductions in military manpower after prolonged campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. is turning once again to developing key technologies to offset its quantitative inferiority in conventional forces. The U.S. has pursued this offset strategy twice before-the first time was in the 1950s with nuclear deterrence countering the numerically superior armament and fighting forces of the Warsaw Pact, and the second time was in the 1970s with DARPA-led efforts to gain technological superiority from enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, precision-guided weapons, stealth technology, and space-based communications and navigation. The current Third Offset Strategy targets many promising innovations including robotics and autonomous systems, miniaturization, big data, and advanced manufacturing. The U.S. military has even created a number of new organizations such as the Army Cyber Institute to explore high-tech innovation and the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental to expedite the transfer of cutting-edge technology to warfighters. Nonetheless, some critics believe the U.S. military is such an unwieldy bureaucracy that it lacks the nimbleness to transform into a force that can win tomorrow's wars—particularly in cyberspace. These critics also note that most of the innovation the U.S. currently seeks come from ground-breaking research—the type of innovation that is expensive to develop. This paper proposes that by adding disruptive innovations—the type of innovation that tends to be cheaper and less technologically complex—into its R&D portfolio mix, the U.S. military will not only strengthen its offset strategy, it will also better protect itself from future threats by reducing the likelihood of strategic surprise. In this paper, we review Christensen and Bower's disruptive technologies framework, illuminate successful disruptive innovations in military history, and provide insights into how the U.S. can foster disruptive innovation.",2016 International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon U.S.),2016,,,1-5,"Wong, Ernest Y.; Sambaluk, Nicholas M.",Purdue University West Lafayette,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095436062,0,
pub.1014568803,10.4324/9781315460697,Defending the Arsenal,"One important area of interest within military and policy circles focuses on an effort to revitalize the nuclear triad amidst a number of competing strategic interests. The difficulties arising from US engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan are leading many scholars and policy makers to question whether a reinvigorated nuclear triad has any role in deterring modern adversaries. This volume takes an unashamed pro-nuclear modernization position and argues for designing and fielding new nuclear warheads and delivery systems (submarine, ICBM, and bomber) while also arguing against signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or agreeing to further reductions in the nuclear arsenal. It also argues that nuclear deterrence remains as relevant today, perhaps more, than it was during the Cold War. With so many authors advocating for ""Global Zero"" and highlighting perceived dangers from a nuclear arsenal, this work stands in stark contrast to the chorus of anti-arsenal works. Because of the work’s structure and effort to answer questions of current relevance, it should appeal to a broad audience including: service staffs, PME students, COCOM staffs, Pentagon personnel, Capitol Hill staffers, policy makers, academics, graduate students, and interested readers.

After years of research, Pakistan proudly set off an atomic bomb in 1998 and became the first Muslim nation to join the nuclear community. Primarily, the reason of nuclear deterrence of Pakistan will be propound as part of their historical conflicts with India and Indian threat was the major motive for Pakistan unveiling its nuclear card. The explosion caused tensions around the world and further strained diplomatic relations between Pakistan and its main rival India, which had detonated its own atomic device in 1974. The original Pakistani effort to build the atomic bomb began in the 1950s and reached a fever pitch during the Jimmy Carter administration when Pakistan made a deal with France for a reprocessing plant that could create fissionable plutonium. The other part would emphasize the key part of the nuclear programme of Pakistan. In such context, this paper is an attempt to touch various issues regarding development of nuclear power in Pakistan, while highlighting the role of external powers which would contribute to the transitory nature of their dynamic relations to develop nuclear power in Pakistan. The data were collected mainly from   secondary sources. The research concludes that the Pakistan may have no choice but to gain nuclear capability, to ensure its survival , and has developed its own nuclear weapons in order to strengthen its bargaining position vis-à-vis India and reduce its dependence on external sources.",International Research Journal of Management IT and Social Sciences,2016,3,9,57,"Aliff, S.M.; Fowsar, M.A.M",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069248176,1,

The complexity of deterrence and the lack of attention that has been paid to its social effects have too often left one of its forms – nuclear deterrence – depoliticized, uncontested, and thus a danger to us all. I argue in this article that speech act theory can provide insights into deterrence and its concomitant political effects. It can be used to philosophically explain the communicative difficulties involved in deterrent relationships, and to form a basis for a critical stance on deterrence as politics. This entails a shift of focus from deterrence as a state of mind to the politics of deterrence and the deontic powers it wields – a shift from the causative aspects of deterrence to the deontology of deterrents. The analysis of such political functions is aided by the neologism of deterrentification, which refers to assertive and declarative acts that alter the status functions of things so that they are thought to act as deterrents and bring about determent in someone or something. It also aids in conceptualizing how the status of deterrents can be cancelled, and how nuclear weapons can be drawn away from the exceptional sphere of deterrence and back into the sphere of politics. Such a status transformation is required to achieve a sustained nuclear disarmament.",New Perspectives,2016,24,2,23-50,"Vuori, Juha A.",University of Helsinki,Finland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125127490,14,"[Sbisà, Marina]|[ur.011657724726.30]|Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|1999|9|1‐2|9-11|10.1525/jlin.1999.9.1-2.9|pub.1002029886|1;[Sbisá, Marina; Fabbri, Paolo]|[; ]|Journal of Pragmatics|1980|4|4|301-319|10.1016/0378-2166(80)90027-2|pub.1010137462|18;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1979|31|2|289-324|10.2307/2009945|pub.1013991718|128;[Lupovici, Amir]|[ur.012215620273.00]|International Studies Quarterly|2010|54|3|705-732|10.1111/j.1468-2478.2010.00606.x|pub.1014733017|34;[Sbisà, Marina]|[ur.011657724726.30]|Journal of Pragmatics|2001|33|12|1791-1814|10.1016/s0378-2166(00)00060-6|pub.1016706017|63;[Dalaqua, Renata H.]|[]|Brazilian Political Science Review|2013|7|3|90-117|10.1590/s1981-38212013000300004|pub.1018225437|3;[Lebow, Richard Ned]|[ur.011434531375.46]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2005|28|5|765-773|10.1080/01402390500393852|pub.1024473575|7;[Sbisà, Marina]|[ur.011657724726.30]|Language & Communication|2002|22|4|421-436|10.1016/s0271-5309(02)00018-6|pub.1032229819|54;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2005|28|5|751-763|10.1080/01402390500393837|pub.1033008975|8;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2005|28|5|789-801|10.1080/01402390500393944|pub.1033267850|4;[Vuori, Juha A.]|[ur.07747623575.22]|European Journal of International Relations|2008|14|1|65-99|10.1177/1354066107087767|pub.1036202977|124;[Sbisà, Marina]|[]|Journal of Pragmatics|1984|8|1|93-112|10.1016/0378-2166(84)90066-3|pub.1038763614|29;[de Santana, Anne Harrington]|[ur.016574304071.19]|The Nonproliferation Review|2009|16|3|325-345|10.1080/10736700903255029|pub.1049050843|22;[Vuori, Juha A.]|[ur.07747623575.22]|Security Dialogue|2010|41|3|255-277|10.1177/0967010610370225|pub.1052526258|46;[Sbisà, Marina]|[]|Pragmatics|2007|17|3|461-473|10.1075/prag.17.3.06sbi|pub.1058241023|35;[Cohn, Carol]|[]|Signs|1987|12|4|687-718|10.1086/494362|pub.1058778350|595;[Kavka, Gregory S.]|[]|The Journal of Philosophy|1978|75|6|285|10.2307/2025707|pub.1069704352|39;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]||2003||||10.1017/cbo9780511491573|pub.1098665879|78;[Tannenwald, Nina]|[]||2007||||10.1017/cbo9780511491726|pub.1098665913|146;[Lupovici, Amir]|[ur.012215620273.00]||2016||||10.1017/cbo9781316534540|pub.1098672368|15;[Searle, John R.]|[]||1969||||10.1017/cbo9781139173438|pub.1098681689|6373;[Austin, J.L.]|[]||1975||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198245537.001.0001|pub.1098775267|3763"

Nuclear deterrence formed the foundation of U.S. Cold War doctrine and the basis of an extended security guarantee to our allies. But the Cold War ended one-quarter century ago, and questions about the efficacy of deterrence, the need for nuclear weapons, and the ethics surrounding them have resurfaced as some call for further major reductions in inventory or the complete elimination of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Discussed from the perspective of a military practitioner, this essay highlights the continuing need for U.S. nuclear weapons in a global security environment that is highly complex and uncertain, and describes the means by which the credibility of the nuclear portion of the strategic deterrent is being preserved even as the role and prominence of these weapons have been reduced.",Daedalus,2016,145,4,50-61,"Kehler, C.

pub.1040292582,10.1080/01402390.2016.1168010,Japan and Extended Nuclear Deterrence: Security and Non-proliferation,"To an observer, Japan’s approach to nuclear weapons can appear confused and contradictory. The only country to have been attacked with nuclear weapons is variously described as a pacifist and non-nuclear nation and as a proliferation threat. These widely varied and conflicting conclusions are understandable given that conflicting messages are sent by senior figures. However Japan’s stance is in fact a coherent, if not uncomplicated, response both to its security needs and to domestic public opinion.

German Experiences with Nuclear Consultation in NATO,"Recent nuclear-weapons-related consultation in NATO within the framework of the Defence and Deterrence Posture Review sheds light on historical experiences with nuclear consultation in NATO. In the early years of the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), which became the main forum for multilateral nuclear consultation in the alliance, developing a nuclear weapons first use doctrine was of particular importance. This process led to the adoption of the Provisional Political Guidelines (PPGs) on the threat to initiate the use of nuclear weapons.

In what depth should it discuss issues of doctrine and targeting with its Asian allies? What capabilities might reassure European allies in light of current Russian revisionism? Could nuclear war be limited and controlled in an East Asian maritime arena? Do nuclear weapons strengthen an alliance, or do they introduce a divisive bone of contention? Is extended nuclear deterrence (END) stabilizing or is it on the contrary pushing the allies to ask for more? What is the relationship between nuclear and conventional forces in END credibility? How do nuclear alliances contribute to international security and international order? The lessons and insights from these papers, which look at five historical cases of US extended deterrence during the Cold War, should help us think about crucial current issues, and be of use both to historians who want to have a better understanding of the Cold War past and to policymakers who are currently grappling with these issues.",Journal of Strategic Studies,2016,39,4,1-7,"Nuti, Leopoldo; Ostermann, Christian",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019259032,1,"[Weltman, John J.]|[]|International Security|1981|6|3|182|10.2307/2538613|pub.1069980305|9;[Nichols, Thomas M.]|[]||2014||||10.9783/9780812209068|pub.1096112497|3;[Larsen, Jeffrey A.; Kartchner, Kerry M.]|[ur.011342667426.85; ur.012326751747.11]||2014||||10.1515/9780804790918|pub.1129545739|8"

That policy, however, is carried out in the changed international space compared with the times of the Cold War. The period of detente in relations between world powers was dominated inter alia by discussion on the humanitarian intervention. Human rights, tied to the value of justice, become the most important component of international order. Thus, justice has become the value of the international legal order equivalent to peace. In such a reality, the legitimacy of nuclear weapons should be based not only on the deterrence, but also on the need to protect human rights, tied with justice. Possession of nuclear weapons per se is contrary to this value. This fact should be taken into account in the world powers’ policies.

In particular, this book seeks to interrogate the theory and strategy of nuclear deterrence, and its relationship to the concept of missile defence. Drawing widely on the theoretical literature in international relations and strategic studies, it identifies the key groups that have competed over America's nuclear policy post-1945 and examines how the concept of missile defence went through a process of gestation and intellectual contestation, leading to its eventual legitimization in the late 1990s. Steff sheds light on the individuals, groups, institutions and processes that led to the decision by the Bush administration to deploy a national missile defence shield. Additionally, Steff systematically examines the impact deployment had on the calculations of Russia and China. In the process he explains that their reactions under the Bush administration have continued into the Obama era, revealing that a new great power security dilemma has broken out.

Key figures are Roberto Matta and Wolfgang Paalen (as “first responders” in the 1940s), Situationists such as Debord and Vaneigem in the late 1950s and 1960s (effecting a repoliticization of avant-garde aesthetics), later writings by ex-Situationists and pro-Situs such as René Riesel and Jaime Semprun, as well as contemporary artists such as Ei Arakawa and The Otolith Group (and their responses to Fukushima). Through concepts and tropes such as invisibility, survival and mutation, these practitioners seek to counteract the “insensible” nature of radiation and problematize post-war society’s dependency on nuclear deterrence and “peaceful” nuclear technology alike.",The Nordic Journal of Aesthetics,2016,24,49-50,,"Lütticken, Sven Lütticken",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1083521719,0,

This development has several political and strategic implications that pose the need to find specifically political answers. What is often forgotten or neglected is the increasing importance of understanding cyberspace as a political domain and cyberpolitics is needed more than ever before. The current developments in cybersecurity and cyberwarfare certainly have a number of implications but the aim of this article is to explore five consequences which are critical when evaluating both political and military aspects of cyberwarfare and its political future: the race for talented people; the need to develop a proportionate political response framework before a disruptive or destructive cyber incident occurs; the increasing necessity to expose some cyber capabilities in order to strengthen cyber deterrence; the importance of integrating physical and digital domains in order to be able to operate in the combined cyber–physical environment; and the requirement for deeper international cooperation.,Journal of Cyber Policy,2016,1,1,50-60,"Limnéll, Jarno",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028776885,3,"[]|[]||2014||||10.1007/978-3-642-37481-4|pub.1023830655|16;[Kuusisto, Tuija; Kuusisto, Rauno]|[ur.014517764435.55; ur.014210650527.44]|Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering|2015|78||31-43|10.1007/978-3-319-18302-2_2|pub.1045965348|4;[Loukas, George]|[]|Cyber-Physical Attacks|2015|||221-253|10.1016/b978-0-12-801290-1.00007-2|pub.1048253174|12"

pub.1053683579,10.1111/1468-2346.12509,Russian hybrid warfare and extended deterrence in eastern Europe,"Russia's use of force against Ukraine since early 2014 has prompted some observers to remark that it is engaging in ‘hybrid warfare’. This form of military statecraft has made other former Soviet republics, such as the Baltic countries, fear that Russia would use subversion rather than pursue a conventional military engagement against them. Despite this concern about Russian hybrid war, existing descriptions of this form of war suffer from conceptual weaknesses. In this article hybrid warfare is conceived as a strategy that marries conventional deterrence and insurgency tactics. That is, the belligerent uses insurgent tactics against its target while using its conventional military power to deter a strong military response. The article then outlines why some former Soviet republics are susceptible to Russian hybrid warfare, allowing it to postulate inductively the conditions under which hybrid warfare might be used in general. The analysis yields two policy implications. First, military solutions are not wholly appropriate against hybrid warfare since it exploits latent ethnic grievances and weak civil societies. Second, only under narrow circumstances would belligerents resort to hybrid warfare. Belligerents need to be revisionist and militarily stronger than their targets, but they also need to have ethnic or linguistic ties with the target society to leverage in waging hybrid warfare.",International Affairs,2016,92,1,175-195,"LANOSZKA, ALEXANDER",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053683579,42,

pub.1101735542,10.2139/ssrn.2766017,The Short Life and Quick Death of Cyber Deterrence (How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Cyber),"In 2015, the United States took three significant steps to developing a cyber deterrence policy. In April, the Department of Defense released the DoD Cyber Strategy. At the same time, President Obama issued an Executive Order authorizing sanctions against cyber actors. And in December, the White House released its long-anticipated cyber deterrence policy. Specifically, the White House policy is built on a two-element strategy of deterrence by denial; and deterrence through cost imposition. Unfortunately, the White House policy does little to address or answer the thorny questions raised by the reality of today's cybersecurity environment. First, the policy relies on traditional notions of deterrence that may have been effective in prior nuclear and non-nuclear contexts, but it ill-suited to cybersecurity. Second, the policy focuses primarily on defensive strategies and does not confront the reality and likelihood of offensive counter-operations. Third, insomuch as deterrence is a public relations communications strategy and psychological game backed by capability and credibility, the United States has a poor track record of deterring cyber-attacks. To understand this problem, my research begins with a brief historical review of the development of deterrence theory, in particular as it relates to conventional war and the Cold War. Next, I turn to the development of cyber deterrence as a strategy of the American government, and in particular, recent efforts by the United States to define a cyber deterrence policy. In that light, I examine the White House cyber deterrence policy from a historical and critical perspective, and especially given the distinct characteristics that distinguish cyber deterrence from traditional deterrence. Finally, this paper will discuss whether deterrence is even a reasonable strategy in the cyber environment. Ultimately, this paper concludes that the current synthesis of cyber deterrence is unworkable and ought to be scrapped. As a result, cyber deterrence as an overall public relations strategy should be de-emphasized as part of an aggressive cyberspace strategy that acknowledges both defensive and offensive capabilities. To be sure, sub-components of the current policy, like strengthening networks to reducing the incentive to conduct cyber-attacks, are laudable goals that the United States should continue to pursue. However, relying on deterrence by denial as a publicly communicated strategy to discourage attacks has failed, and continues to fail with each new attack. Instead, American efforts should focus on improving attribution, not as a deterrent measure, but to allow policy makers the ability to respond to attacks with offensive cyber capabilities.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2016,,,,"Schearer, Michael",Liberty University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101735542,0,

pub.1102465630,10.2139/ssrn.2836206,The Cartwright Conjecture: The Deterrent Value and Escalatory Risk of Fearsome Cyber Capabilities,"In light of advocates that argue cyber deterrence can result simply from the existence and showboating of cyber capabilities, this paper explores a variety of historical case studies to illustrate that cyber conflict is often more escalatory than not, including relevant cases such as Stuxnet (involving the United States, Iran, and Israel), North Korea, Russia, and China. These analyses demonstrate that U.S. cyber-related actions often lead to misinterpretations and overreactions by adversaries, resulting in those states increasing their own cyber capabilities as a result of fear. Thus, this paper suggests that a policy of deterrence built on the existence, and showcasing, of cyber capabilities is just as likely to lead to inflamed relationships between states as it is to lead to improved deterrence. In terms of policy implications, this paper largely argues that even the simplest of technical changes or advancements in U.S. cyber capabilities can cause a number of unintended consequences, due in large part to political leaders’ tendencies to react illogically and with certain hawkish and optimistic bias, leading to general geopolitical uncertainties. This argument coincides with the Journal of Cybersecurity’s efforts to demonstrate the importance of melding perspectives from both technological and political experts, and argues that foreign policy decisions cannot be isolated from technological ones.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2016,,,,"Healey, Jason",Columbia University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102465630,0,
pub.1090421559,10.2139/ssrn.2836100,"Disintermediation, Counterinsurgency, and Cyber Defense","In the early days of the Internet, many predicted that the Internet would be an engine of disintermediation, radically altering the economics of business and commerce. The notion was that the Internet would directly connect producers to consumers, removing any intermediary whose sole value was to bridge that gap. Many businesses failed because they did not adapt and others adapted and prospered. The process of disintermediation that altered Internet business had both profound and unanticipated effects. While business processes have been disintermediated, so has crime, espionage, and warfare. The Internet directly connects criminal organizations to their victims, enabling personal crime over great distances and at large scale. Similarly, with espionage and warfare. The traditional role of Governments as an intermediary providing safety and security has been disintermediated within cyberspace. Government cannot defend cyberspace, leaving organizations to defend themselves. The best model for cyber-defense is to look at cyber-attackers as guerilla insurgents and cyber-defense as counterinsurgency. Understood in this way, cyber-defense has direct analogues to the clear-hold-build of counterinsurgency and is dependent on specialized training and comprehensive intelligence. The difficulty organizations have in attaining and maintaining the specialized training and comprehensive intelligence needed has created a marketplace for contracting out cyber-defense to specialized companies. Yet, even specialized companies are limited in the actions they can pursue in cyber-defense because of the legal regime in which they operate. The legal options in cyber-defense needs changes that would allow private companies to take actions consistent with the self-defense constraints of necessity, proportionality, and immediacy, and improve an organizations’ ability to both defend itself and attribute actions to the aggressors. This, in turn, would raise the bar of cyber deterrence, making cyberspace safer for all.

Just like India and Pakistan, Israel has secretly developed a nuclear arsenal, but unlike the two, Israel did not advertise its possession of nuclear weapons by publicly declaring or testing them. Indeed, even today the Israeli government refuses to say anything factual about its nuclear activities, and neither affirms nor denies the existence of an Israeli nuclear arsenal. This policy is commonly referred to today as “nuclear ambiguity” (in Hebrew, the phrase is amimut) and remains Israel’s unique contribution to the nuclear age. Ambiguity has provided Israel with the best of all possible worlds: the advantages of nuclear deterrence to protect against existential threats in an anarchic world (especially against its “hostile” Arab neighbors and a potentially threatening Iran), but almost none of the potential political drawbacks of possessing nuclear weapons, such as the scrutiny—and occasional disapprobation—applied to the world’s eight acknowledged nuclear powers (Cohen and Miller 2010).",Neoliberal Governmentality and the Future of the State in the Middle East and North Africa,2016,,,105-121,"Diskaya, Ali",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037025018,0,
pub.1044933706,10.1007/978-3-319-39964-5_2,Deterrence: A Political and Psychological Critique,"Postwar American security policy was built on a foundation of deterrence. In the early Cold War period, American leaders relied on nuclear deterrence to discourage Soviet or Chinese attacks against American allies in Western Europe and the Far East. When these countries developed the means to launch intercontinental nuclear attacks of their own, the United States counted on deterrence to prevent an attack against itself. Over the years, successive American administrations have also attempted to use deterrence to moderate the policies of Third World states with which the United States or its allies have come into conflict. Partisans of deterrence assert that it has kept the peace between the superpowers and has been useful in managing lesser conflicts. This chapter disputes both claims. When discussing deterrence it is important to distinguish between the theory of deterrence and the strategy of deterrence. The former pertains to the logical postulates of deterrence and the assumptions on which they are based. Put succinctly, deterrence is an attempt to influence another actor’s assessment of its interests. It seeks to prevent an undesired behavior by convincing the party who may be contemplating it that the cost will exceed any possible gain. Deterrence presupposes that decisions are made in response to some kind of rational cost-benefit calculus, that this calculus can be successfully manipulated from the outside, and that the best way to do this is to increase the cost side of the ledger. Different scholars have developed their own variants of deterrence theory. All of them, however, are based on these assumptions. Deterrence strategy is concerned with applying the theory of deterrence to real world conflicts. It has given rise to its own body of theory about how this is best accomplished. The first wave of this theory, almost entirely deductive in nature, was developed in the 1950s and 1960s by such scholars as Brodie (1959), Kaufman (1954), and Schelling (1966). Most of these works stressed the importance of imparting credibility to commitments and explored various mechanisms leaders could exploit toward this end. The literature of this period is often referred to as classical deterrence theory (Jervis 1979).","Pioneers in Arts, Humanities, Science, Engineering, Practice",2016,4,,3-24,"Lebow, Richard Ned",King's College London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044933706,1,"[Lebow, Richard Ned]|[ur.011434531375.46]|Journal of Social Issues|1987|43|4|171-191|10.1111/j.1540-4560.1987.tb00267.x|pub.1001698606|7;[Kaplan, Morton A.]|[ur.015306060307.45]|World Politics|1958|11|1|20-43|10.2307/2009408|pub.1004436123|16;[Hosoya, Chihiro]|[ur.014515652765.46]|Journal of Peace Research|1968|5|2|97-115|10.1177/002234336800500201|pub.1012929120|10;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1979|31|2|289-324|10.2307/2009945|pub.1013991718|128;[Lebow, Richard Ned; Stein, Janice Gross]|[ur.011434531375.46; ur.013222707512.19]|Journal of Social Issues|1987|43|4|5-71|10.1111/j.1540-4560.1987.tb00252.x|pub.1018359140|91;[Tetlock, Philip E.]|[ur.01162325101.71]|Journal of Social Issues|1987|43|4|85-91|10.1111/j.1540-4560.1987.tb00255.x|pub.1023274385|9;[Tripp, Charles]|[]|Survival|1986|28|6|495-509|10.1080/00396338608442332|pub.1024143287|2;[Lebow, Richard Ned; Stein, Janice Gross]|[ur.011434531375.46; ur.013222707512.19]|Journal of Social Issues|1987|43|4|155-169|10.1111/j.1540-4560.1987.tb00266.x|pub.1035373327|8;[Brodie, Bernard]|[]|World Politics|1959|11|2|173-191|10.2307/2009527|pub.1036021891|20;[Russett, Bruce M.]|[ur.01244123154.27]|Journal of Peace Research|1967|4|2|89-105|10.1177/002234336700400201|pub.1038984842|34;[Milburn, Thomas W.]|[]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1959|3|2|138-145|10.1177/002200275900300206|pub.1039612132|22;[Huth, Paul; Russett, Bruce]|[ur.016301126663.22; ur.01244123154.27]|World Politics|1984|36|4|496-526|10.2307/2010184|pub.1040631394|205;[]|[]|Evaluation and Program Planning|1978|1|2|167|10.1016/0149-7189(78)90042-3|pub.1050281949|1459;[Achen, Christopher H.; Snidal, Duncan]|[; ur.010273021353.18]|World Politics|1989|41|2|143-169|10.2307/2010405|pub.1053727425|188;[Bloomfield, Lincoln P.; George, Alexander L.; Smoke, Richard]|[ur.013234401257.26; ur.015106224107.87; ur.014450130517.30]|Political Science Quarterly|1976|91|1|154|10.2307/2149175|pub.1069789178|48;[Sullivan, Michael P.; Snyder, Glenn; Diesing, Paul]|[; ; ]|Political Science Quarterly|1978|93|4|688|10.2307/2150116|pub.1069790136|60;[Lebow, Richard Ned]|[ur.011434531375.46]|International Security|1984|9|1|147|10.2307/2538638|pub.1069980328|37;[Orme, John]|[]|International Security|1987|11|4|96|10.2307/2538838|pub.1069980492|18;[Lebow, Richard Ned]|[ur.011434531375.46]|International Security|1987|12|1|197|10.2307/2538926|pub.1069980564|9;[Lebow, Richard Ned; Stein, Janice Gross]|[ur.011434531375.46; ur.013222707512.19]||1995||||10.1515/9781400821082|pub.1096912834|49"

Military Security,"This chapter discusses the continuing importance of military security, noting how International Relations has historically seen security almost entirely in terms of the military dimension. It first examines the impact of the broadening of the concept of security on approaches to the study of its military dimension before considering the key aspects of the traditional approach to military security and some of the most common ways in which states have sought to acquire it historically, such as war, alliances, and nuclear deterrence. The chapter then explores some of the difficulties in acquiring military security and how its pursuit can sometimes reduce, rather than increase, security. In particular, it analyses arms control as a means of achieving military security. Finally, it shows that military security remains an important field to study, even within a significantly broadened understanding of security as a multifaceted concept.",Contemporary Security Studies,2015,,,,"Sheehan, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120260919,0,

While national policies intended to deter cyber aggression may offer some solution in the short term, their effects in the long term are doubtful. National cyber-deterrence policies entail the risk of an on-going cyber arms race and a cycle of escalation between potential cyber opponents. Diplomacy may offer fewer results in the short term, but it is more promising in the long term. Confidence-building measures and international norms and values may not be easy to reach, but in the end they could be more effective (and cheaper) than a single focus on national cyber-deterrence strategies. In the long term, cooperation between states to establish confidence and commonly accepted norms of behaviour in cyber space are the most promising ways available to achieve enduring cyber security and stability.

pub.1039177182,10.1093/cybsec/tyv003,Tipping the scales: the attribution problem and the feasibility of deterrence against cyberattack,"Cyber attackers rely on deception to exploit vulnerabilities and obfuscate their identity, which makes many pessimistic about cyber deterrence. The attribution problem appears to make retaliatory punishment, contrasted with defensive denial, particularly ineffective. Yet observable deterrence failures against targets of lower value tell us little about the ability to deter attacks against higher value targets, where defenders may be more willing and able to pay the costs of attribution and punishment. Counterintuitively, costs of attribution and response may decline with scale. Reliance on deception is a double-edged sword that provides some advantages to the attacker but undermines offensive coercion and creates risks for ambitious intruders. Many of the properties of cybersecurity assumed to be determined by technology, such as the advantage of offense over defense, the difficulty of attribution, and the inefficacy of deterrence, are in fact consequences of political factors like the value of the target and the scale-dependent costs of exploitation and retaliation. Assumptions about attribution can be incorporated into traditional international relations concepts of uncertainty and credibility, even as attribution involves uncertainty about the identity of the opponent, not just interests and capabilities. This article uses a formal model to explain why there are many low-value anonymous attacks but few high-value ones, showing how different assumptions about the scaling of exploitation and retaliation costs lead to different degrees of coverage and effectiveness for deterrence by denial and punishment. Deterrence works where it is needed most, yet it usually fails everywhere else.",Journal of Cybersecurity,2015,1,1,53-67,"Lindsay, Jon R.",University of Toronto,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039177182,34,"[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[]|International Security|2015|39|3|7-47|10.1162/isec_a_00189|pub.1009167389|39;[Eriksson, Johan; Giacomello, Giampiero]|[ur.011313053563.85; ur.016605246703.81]|International Political Science Review|2006|27|3|221-244|10.1177/0192512106064462|pub.1011300259|51;[Rid, Thomas]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|1|5-32|10.1080/01402390.2011.608939|pub.1012160244|189;[Gompert, David C.; Libicki, Martin]|[ur.015504572435.79; ur.010374462235.52]|Survival|2014|56|4|7-22|10.1080/00396338.2014.941543|pub.1014024369|22;[Lupovici, Amir]|[ur.012215620273.00]|International Studies Perspectives|2014|||n/a-n/a|10.1111/insp.12082|pub.1014853235|4;[POWELL, ROBERT]|[]|American Political Science Review|2004|98|2|231-241|10.1017/s000305540400111x|pub.1017996470|122;[Snyder, Glenn Herald]|[]||1961||||10.1515/9781400877164|pub.1018970969|179;[Cavelty, Myriam Dunn]|[ur.011312752443.31]|Journal of Information Technology & Politics|2008|4|1|19-36|10.1300/j516v04n01_03|pub.1019861984|48;[Liff, Adam P.]|[ur.013410144521.45]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|3|401-428|10.1080/01402390.2012.663252|pub.1021730539|57;[Kello, Lucas]|[ur.013570347306.95]|International Security|2013|38|2|7-40|10.1162/isec_a_00138|pub.1022127711|64;[Inkster, Nigel]|[]|Survival|2015|57|1|105-116|10.1080/00396338.2015.1008301|pub.1024567024|7;[Lindsay, Jon R.]|[]|Security Studies|2013|22|3|365-404|10.1080/09636412.2013.816122|pub.1025246311|117;[Slantchev, Branislav L.; Tarar, Ahmer]|[ur.011457556354.16; ur.014561437233.87]|American Journal of Political Science|2011|55|1|135-148|10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00475.x|pub.1026263261|35;[Leventoğlu, Bahar; Slantchev, Branislav L.]|[ur.01355164620.96; ur.011457556354.16]|American Journal of Political Science|2007|51|4|755-771|10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00279.x|pub.1027767584|54;[Betz, David]|[ur.07642314447.01]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|5|689-711|10.1080/01402390.2012.706970|pub.1029559610|13;[Peterson, Dale]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2013|36|1|120-124|10.1080/01402390.2012.742014|pub.1030115538|26;[Fearon, James D.]|[ur.0773121250.02]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1997|41|1|68-90|10.1177/0022002797041001004|pub.1031866226|428;[Pillar, Paul R.]|[]||1983||||10.1515/9781400856442|pub.1033196144|118;[Rid, Thomas; Buchanan, Ben]|[ur.010444241522.28; ur.013432143522.19]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2015|38|1-2|4-37|10.1080/01402390.2014.977382|pub.1035532991|130;[WEIMANN, GABRIEL]|[]|Studies in Conflict and Terrorism|2005|28|2|129-149|10.1080/10576100590905110|pub.1036944245|71;[Valeriano, Brandon; Maness, Ryan C]|[ur.013636643561.19; ur.013041263161.39]|Journal of Peace Research|2014|51|3|347-360|10.1177/0022343313518940|pub.1037918829|57;[Benson, David C.]|[]|Security Studies|2014|23|2|293-328|10.1080/09636412.2014.905353|pub.1040490420|24;[Gartzke, Erik]|[ur.014753037012.98]|International Security|2013|38|2|41-73|10.1162/isec_a_00136|pub.1041321316|101;[Slantchev, Branislav L.]|[ur.011457556354.16]|International Organization|2010|64|3|357-388|10.1017/s002081831000010x|pub.1042487407|41;[Junio, Timothy J.]|[ur.011572452753.80]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2013|36|1|125-133|10.1080/01402390.2012.739561|pub.1044367889|18;[Fearon, James D.]|[ur.0773121250.02]|International Organization|1995|49|3|379-414|10.1017/s0020818300033324|pub.1046318797|1445;[Heckman, Kristin E.; Walsh, Michael J.; Stech, Frank J.; O'Boyle, Todd A.; DiCato, Stephen R.; Herber, Audra F.]|[ur.010006552477.93; ; ur.010547751421.45; ; ; ]|Computers & Security|2013|37||72-77|10.1016/j.cose.2013.03.015|pub.1049700055|14;[Powell, Robert]|[]|International Organization|2006|60|1|169-203|10.1017/s0020818306060061|pub.1050266503|349;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1978|30|2|167-214|10.2307/2009958|pub.1051767591|949;[Gartzke, Erik; Lindsay, Jon R.]|[ur.014753037012.98; ur.016123225213.98]|Security Studies|2015|24|2|316-348|10.1080/09636412.2015.1038188|pub.1052004488|40;[Beattie, Elisabeth C.; Morton, James J.; Leckie, Brenda J.; Sueiras-Diaz, Javier; Jones, D.

Yet analysis of the historical development trajectory of China's nuclear weapons program suggests it was never intended to support a direct military challenge. Indeed, after developing a nuclear-weapons capability in the 1960s, China produced only a small number of vulnerable nuclear weapons against the expectation of nuclear deterrence theory and despite confrontational relations with both nuclear superpowers.

pub.1094886001,10.1109/malware.2015.7413679,Using Inherent Command and Control Vulnerabilities to Halt DDoS Attacks,"Dirt Jumper is a powerful distributed denial of service (DDoS) family of toolkits (e.g., includes Drive version x, Dirt Jumper version $x$, and Pandora) sold in online black markets. The buyers are typically individuals who seek to infect computers globally and incite them to collectively emit crippling unsolicited network traffic to unsuspecting targets, often for criminal purposes. The Dirt Jumper Family (DJF) of botnets is not new; however, new variants have made the family more destructive and more relevant. The DJF has caused millions of dollars of damage across several different business sectors. Notably in 2014, a European media company was attacked with a 10-hour, 200 gigabit per second DDoS campaign with an estimated impact of $20M. Traditional defensive measures, like firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and defense-in-depth, are not always effective. The threat may hasten the emergence of active defenses to protect Internet-based revenue streams or intellectual property. In practice, some companies have either found legal loopholes that provide immunity, or have decided to leverage the budding relationship between the government and the private sector to Hack Back with implied immunity. Either way, tools are currently being used to defend against hacking. This paper provides: (1) an overview of the present threat posed by the Dirt Jumper family of DDoS toolkits, (2) an overview of the Hacking Back debate and clear examples of the use of legal loopholes or implied immunity, and (3) novel offensive campaigns that could be used to stop active DDoS attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the botnet's command and control (C&C).

Andrew Futter argues that the requirements of deterrence are perhaps more blurred today than at any point in the nuclear age – a situation only likely to get worse. A more holistic and long-term view of UK nuclear policy is needed, with greater consideration given to how techno-military, strategic and, to a lesser extent, political-normative developments are likely to alter, if not transform, the nature of the future deterrence environment.",The RUSI Journal,2015,160,5,60-67,"Futter, Andrew",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010082823,0,

There are today a growing number of countries operating submarines in Southeast Asia, but just how capable are they? Unable to match the large multi-mission navies of countries such as China, India or Japan, many of the smaller economies in Southeast Asia have invested in conventional submarines to deter their neighbours. This article draws on deterrence theory to analyse the significance of submarine proliferation in Southeast Asia on the strategic balance in the region. It systematically examines submarine maintenance and training issues and concludes that the challenges involved in building up and maintaining a submarine force are far greater than is commonly understood or acknowledged. The evidence presented in this article suggests that few countries in the region currently have the capability and strategy to convincingly make the case that their submarine force by themselves could be an effective deterrent. Although the proliferation of submarines in Southeast Asia may suggests a changing strategic balance in the region, the findings of this study underscore the dangers of conflating acquisition of equipment with capabilities in practice.",Contemporary Security Policy,2015,36,3,473-497,"Andersson, Jan Joel",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006072806,1,

It examines the key substantive conclusions that have emerged as a result of this debate and assesses their relevance for the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.

This paper found that the controversies over the THAAD deployment were based not on facts but on misperception and Groupthink. The opposition's arguments that the deployment of the U.S. THAAD could threat Chinese nuclear deterrence posture and require the cost sharing of South Korea were found wrong. South Korean people should recognize that misperception and groupthink are the main causes of the controversies over the THAAD deployment and try not to be affected anymore. The peoples in the opposition side should try to be more responsible for the national security. South Korean government and the military should establish the clear policies against the North Korean nuclear threat explain them and related information to the people in a timely manner.",Public Policy Review,2015,29,3,25-48,"Park, Hwee Rhak",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113206866,1,

This paper combines deterrence and interdependence in a proposed theory of major power peace, with reference to a number of insightful works on the ongoing transition of power from the US to a rising China. The paper explores the hypothesis that as long as the US and China can deter each other with a combination of conventional and nuclear forces, and refrain from actions to drastically reduce their economic dependence on each other, there is little risk of war between them. Peace will be further secured if important third party countries, notably Japan, remain covered by US extended deterrence and integrated economically with both China and the USA through trade and transnational production chains. Only if the US, Chinese or Japanese governments take politically motivated actions to radically reduce their economic dependence on one another are they likely to engage in a security competition of sufficient intensity to generate an arms race and a substantial risk of war. This does not just hold for all-out war but for limited war as well, given the risk of escalation.",International Area Studies Review,2015,18,3,297-311,"Tønnesson, Stein",Uppsala University; Peace Research Institute,Sweden; Norway,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008833688,3,"[Waltz, Kenneth N.]|[]|The Adelphi Papers|1981|21|171|1-1|10.1080/05679328108457394|pub.1001392419|74;[Yan, Xuetong]|[]|East Asia|2003|20|4|29-51|10.1007/s12140-003-0009-0|pub.1016808725|1;[Layne, Christopher]|[]|International Security|1997|22|1|86-124|10.1162/isec.22.1.86|pub.1026912686|100;[O'Neil, Andrew]|[]||2013||||10.4324/9780203374535|pub.1045959693|5;[Cooper, Richard N.]|[]|The Next Great War?|2014|||57-70|10.7551/mitpress/9780262028998.003.0005|pub.1087387556|2;[Allison, Graham]|[]|The Next Great War?|2014|||73-80|10.7551/mitpress/9780262028998.003.0006|pub.1087387557|10;[Solingen, Etel]|[ur.016240774077.45]|The Next Great War?|2014|||127-148|10.7551/mitpress/9780262028998.003.0010|pub.1087387561|2;[Pekkanen, Saadia; Ravenhill, John; Foot, Rosemary; Khong, Yuen Foong]|[; ; ur.013303116521.32; ur.07543220627.99]|The Oxford Handbook of the International Relations of Asia|2014||||10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199916245.013.0005|pub.1089117121|1;[Pekkanen, Saadia; Ravenhill, John; Foot, Rosemary; Ravenhill, John]|[; ; ur.013303116521.32; ]|The Oxford Handbook of the International Relations of Asia|2014||||10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199916245.013.0018|pub.1089117134|2;[Pekkanen, Saadia; Ravenhill, John; Foot, Rosemary; Yuan, Jingdong]|[; ; ur.013303116521.32; ]|The Oxford Handbook of the International Relations of Asia|2014||||10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199916245.013.0026|pub.1089117142|1;[Pekkanen, Saadia; Ravenhill, John; Foot, Rosemary; Yoshimatsu, Hidetaka]|[; ; ur.013303116521.32; ]|The Oxford Handbook of the International Relations of Asia|2014||||10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199916245.013.0029|pub.1089117145|3;[Kupchan, Charles A.; Kupchan, Charles A.]|[; ]||2010||||10.1515/9781400834419|pub.1096908523|62;[Chan, Steve]|[]||2013||||10.1017/cbo9781139649667|pub.1098669253|9;[]|[]||2014||||10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199916245.001.0001|pub.1108851630|2;[Lampton, David M.]|[]||2014||||10.1525/9780520957398|pub.1113986602|29;[Mearsheimer, John J.]|[]|Curr. hist.|2006|105|690|160-162|10.1525/curh.2006.105.690.160|pub.1127800993|123"

The concept of rationality is ubiquitous; scholars, pundits, and practitioners turn to it, sometimes unwittingly, to describe, explain, and predict. When concerning concrete security and foreign policies, however, this praxis borders on malpractice: rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of “rationality” they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between “us and them.” Empirically, I show that rationality has played an opaque and excessive role in the Western accounts of Iranian nuclear policy. Both “optimists” and “pessimists” have frequently, but faultily, turned to rationality/irrationality to explain Iran’s moderate/belligerent nuclear policy and its susceptibility/resistance to nuclear deterrence.

pub.1015042672,10.1080/01402390.2015.1014473,Indian Military Modernization and Conventional Deterrence in South Asia,"In recent years, headline grabbing increases in the Indian defense budget have raised concerns that India’s on-going military modernization threatens to upset the delicate conventional military balance vis-à-vis Pakistan. Such an eventuality is taken as justification for Islamabad’s pursuit of tactical-nuclear weapons and other actions that have worrisome implications for strategic stability on the subcontinent. This article examines the prospects for Pakistan’s conventional deterrence in the near to medium term, and concludes that it is much better than the pessimists allege. A host of factors, including terrain, the favorable deployment of Pakistani forces, and a lack of strategic surprise in the most likely conflict scenarios, will mitigate whatever advantages India may be gaining through military modernization. Despite a growing technological edge in some areas, Indian policymakers cannot be confident that even a limited resort to military force would achieve a rapid result, which is an essential pre-condition for deterrence failure.",Journal of Strategic Studies,2015,38,5,729-772,"Ladwig, Walter C.",King's College London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015042672,10,"[Arquilla, John]|[]|Comparative Strategy|1997|16|1|13-31|10.1080/01495939708403090|pub.1001149294|6;[Kanwal, Gurmeet]|[ur.012157337525.55]|The India-Pakistan Military Standoff|2011|||67-95|10.1057/9780230118768_4|pub.1004078210|1;[Cohen, Eliot A.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2004|27|3|395-407|10.1080/1362369042000283958|pub.1004582021|29;[Mirski, Sean]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2013|36|3|385-421|10.1080/01402390.2012.743885|pub.1004989033|25;[Khan, Feroz Hassan]|[]|The RUSI Journal|2011|156|5|44-51|10.1080/03071847.2011.626274|pub.1007631765|1;[Thayer, Bradley A.]|[ur.013110745341.44]|Security Studies|2000|10|1|43-85|10.1080/09636410008429420|pub.1013419309|3;[Holmes, James R.; Winner, Andrew C.; Yoshihara, Toshi]|[ur.012010020711.88; ur.014775722711.42; ur.013402761711.83]||2009||||10.4324/9780203878026|pub.1016598030|14;[Lambeth, Benjamin S.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|3|289-316|10.1080/01402390.2012.665350|pub.1021379576|5;[Grauer, Ryan; Horowitz, Michael C.]|[; ]|Security Studies|2012|21|1|83-112|10.1080/09636412.2012.650594|pub.1021661825|15;[Gill, John H.]|[]|Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia|2009|||92-129|10.1017/cbo9780511691805.005|pub.1027215651|4;[Glosny, Michael A.]|[]|International Security|2004|28|4|125-160|10.1162/0162288041588269|pub.1027989382|16;[Ganguly, Sumit; Kraig, Michael R.]|[; ]|Security Studies|2005|14|2|290-324|10.1080/09636410500232958|pub.1033676908|11;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|International Security|1997|21|3|54-86|10.1162/isec.21.3.54|pub.1035180213|60;[Huth, Paul; Russett, Bruce]|[ur.016301126663.22; ur.01244123154.27]|World Politics|1984|36|4|496-526|10.2307/2010184|pub.1040631394|205;[Joshi, Shashank]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2013|36|3|159-172|10.1080/0163660x.2013.825557|pub.1044719505|6;[Stone, John]|[]|Contemporary Security Policy|2012|33|1|108-123|10.1080/13523260.2012.659591|pub.1048446602|7;[Ladwig, Walter C.]|[ur.014031057715.41]|International Security|2008|32|3|158-190|10.1162/isec.2008.32.3.158|pub.1048968283|35;[Biddle, Stephen D.]|[]|International Security|2005|30|3|161-176|10.1162/016228805775969555|pub.1063349191|22;[Shafer, D.

pub.1038366844,10.1080/23337486.2015.1050266,Hiroshima and two paradoxes of Japanese nuclear perplexity,"For the Japanese people, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 are singular moments of holocaust which have produced collective memories so powerful that repeated attempts by Japanese policymakers to introduce or even discuss a nuclear deterrent have been severely contested and sanctioned. Even so, Japan’s enduring rivalries with nuclear-armed China and North Korea have produced a powerful conviction among Japanese policymakers that US extended nuclear deterrence cannot be given up. Thus, two of the most pronounced paradoxes of the nuclear age are (1) the social construction of Japan whose people are simultaneously “allergic” to nuclear weapons but who do not wish to have it “treated”, and (2) successive Japanese governments which are forced to endure the “nuclear allergy” but which also will not be rid of the “allergens”. This paper develops a theoretical account of the discourse of “nuclear allergy” and thereafter explores more fully the paradoxes of nuclear allergies which must never be treated and allergens which must never be expelled.",Critical Military Studies,2015,1,2,160-173,"Doyle, Thomas E.",Texas State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038366844,1,"[Amano, Yukiya]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|2002|9|1|132-145|10.1080/10736700208436879|pub.1012049991|2;[Doyle, II Thomas E.]|[]||2015||||10.4324/9780203100042|pub.1033981911|2;[Hook, Glenn D.]|[ur.016574163307.62]|Journal of Peace Research|1984|21|3|259-275|10.1177/002234338402100305|pub.1054019913|20;[Doyle, Thomas E]|[ur.011013370276.47]|Journal of International Political Theory|2015|11|2|257-273|10.1177/1755088215571648|pub.1064076239|4;[Igarashi, Yoshikuni]|[ur.011575416327.84]|The Journal of Asian Studies|2002|61|2|729-730|10.2307/2700340|pub.1070066877|21;[]|[]|Choice|2012|49|10|49-5937-49-5937|10.5860/choice.49-5937|pub.1073453829|9;[]|[]|Choice|2013|50|11|50-6430-50-6430|10.5860/choice.50-6430|pub.1073461600|8;[Hollis, Martin]|[]||1994||||10.1017/ccol0521447801|pub.1098672274|187;[Zwigenberg, Ran]|[ur.016273734561.64]||2014||||10.1017/cbo9781107775442|pub.1098679936|16;[Orr, James J.]|[]||2001||||10.1515/9780824865153|pub.1120585210|63;[Wittner, Lawrence S.]|[]||2009||||10.1515/9780804771245|pub.1128959177|16"

The first is the so-called pivot towards the region in terms of overall defence strategy. The second, occurring at roughly the same time, is a move towards a far greater role for advanced conventional weaponry in the US defence posture. We analyse the interaction of these two trends and discusses a central tension between short and long-term challenges, suggesting that, contrary to current developments, either a freeze in the deployment of these weapons programmes or a return to a strategy underpinned by traditional notions of deterrence may well be necessary.",The Pacific Review,2015,28,3,367-390,"Futter, Andrew; Zala, Benjamin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040898329,2,"[Phillips, Andrew]|[]|The Pacific Review|2013|26|1|17-38|10.1080/09512748.2013.755362|pub.1000827648|31;[Futter, Andrew]|[]||2013||||10.4324/9780203584477|pub.1000845765|6;[OBAMA, BARACK]|[ur.01001525435.50]|Presidential Studies Quarterly|2009|39|3|429-430|10.1111/j.1741-5705.2009.03698.x|pub.1001693135|64;[Hughes, Christopher W.]|[ur.012320450211.29]|Asia Policy|2007|3|1|75-104|10.1353/asp.2007.0000|pub.1002464502|9;[Florini, Ann]|[ur.07364362032.51]|International Studies Review|2011|13|1|24-33|10.1111/j.1468-2486.2010.00995.x|pub.1003736671|13;[O’Neil, Andrew]|[]||2007||||10.1057/9780230607071|pub.1004330444|5;[Zadra, Roberto]|[]|The RUSI Journal|2010|155|5|12-16|10.1080/03071847.2010.530498|pub.1009148574|2;[Brown, Harold]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2008|31|1|7-22|10.1162/wash.2007.31.1.7|pub.1010747171|2;[McDonough, David S.]|[]||2013||||10.4324/9780203717462|pub.1013611376|5;[Snyder, Scott]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|2011|18|1|147-163|10.1080/10736700.2011.549178|pub.1014594525|1;[Hughes, Christopher W.]|[]|Space Policy|2013|29|2|128-134|10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.03.004|pub.1020414884|5;[Shen, Dingli]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2009|32|4|175-188|10.1080/01636600903232251|pub.1021202809|7;[Fravel, M.

pub.1000988366,10.1080/14678802.2015.1055120,Do nuclear weapons affect the guns-butter trade-off? Evidence on nuclear substitution from Pakistan and beyond,"Scholars have argued that acquiring nuclear weapons should allow states the luxury of exiting conventional arms races. In turn, a decreased budgetary focus on conventional arms should make possible greater spending on social welfare. I contest this logic of nuclear substitution by examining its most likely exponent, Pakistan. As a poor, under-developed state, a nuclear Pakistan should have welcomed the opportunity to cease its arms race with India, and spend greater sums on its population's welfare. Instead, I show Pakistan has doubled down on its pre-nuclear conventional posture, mainly because of its revisionism over Kashmir. More generally, I show nuclear substitution should happen only rarely: when a state is satisfied with the territorial status-quo, and its security challenges are amenable to pure nuclear deterrence. An empirical overview of conventional postures in Britain, China, France, India, Israel, the Soviet Union and the United States shows these conditions are met rarely, and never sustained. The argument has implications concerning the marginal welfare effects of nuclear weapons, the stability-instability paradox in South Asia and the standoff between Iran and the West.",Conflict Security and Development,2015,15,3,229-257,"Butt, Ahsan I.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000988366,1,"[PRESS, DARYL G.; SAGAN, SCOTT D.; VALENTINO, BENJAMIN A.]|[ur.010130626705.72; ur.01045127243.12; ur.016200126625.29]|American Political Science Review|2013|107|1|188-206|10.1017/s0003055412000597|pub.1001757172|59;[Hoyt, Timothy D.]|[]|Asian Survey|2001|41|6|956-977|10.1525/as.2001.41.6.956|pub.1002196983|9;[Narang, Vipin]|[ur.015524123107.00]|International Security|2010|34|3|38-78|10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38|pub.1003337139|34;[Finkelstein, David M.]|[]|Asia Policy|2007|4|1|67-72|10.1353/asp.2007.0017|pub.1003784781|4;[Hoag, Malcolm W.]|[ur.07450605530.09]|World Politics|1961|13|4|505-527|10.2307/2009433|pub.1005206014|8;[Gupta, Amit]|[]|Asian Survey|1995|35|5|441-458|10.2307/2645747|pub.1005684020|4;[Brands, Hal; Palkki, David]|[ur.015610452433.10; ur.016406033033.56]|International Security|2011|36|1|133-166|10.1162/isec_a_00047|pub.1006456621|15;[Fravel, M.

The consensus among experts is that cyberdeterrence is difficult at best and perhaps impossible, due to difficulties in holding aggressors at risk, the technical challenges of attribution, and legal restrictions such as the UN Charter's prohibition against the use of force. Consequently, cyberspace defenders have prioritized increasing the size and strength of the metaphorical “walls” in cyberspace over facilitating deterrent measures. The notion of cyberdeterrence is especially daunting when considering how small states can deter larger, militarily more powerful states. For example, how would Estonia or Japan conduct deterrence through cyberspace against larger regional adversaries with more robust military capabilities? The power disparities between nations of such different military stature are seemingly overwhelming and insurmountable. It is these disparities in cyber power that present conceptual challenges, especially when measuring power in terms of military size, budget, strength, and technological capabilities. “Power,” however, is a broad term that should be considered beyond the military context. This is especially true in cyberspace, where a nation without a strong military can hold a militarily powerful nation at risk, so long as the former is aware of their strategic advantages as well as the critical vulnerabilities of the latter. Given this reality, this paper shall suspend, or at least cast reasonable doubt on, the notion that cyberdeterrence is either difficult or impossible. Using a deductive method to analyze the components of cyberdeterrence strategy and examine the various challenges involved, this paper introduces a hypothesis on how small, less powerful states can hold large powerful states at risk through cyberspace.",2015 7th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Architectures in Cyberspace,2015,,,7-24,"Rivera, Jason",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094585939,2,"[Denning, Dorothy E.]|[]|Future Internet|2012|4|3|672-687|10.3390/fi4030672|pub.1001227314|37;[Rédei, George P.]|[]|Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics|2008|||951-951|10.1007/978-1-4020-6754-9_8160|pub.1043845707|8642;[]|[]|SpringerReference|2011||||10.1007/springerreference_20185|pub.1089571240|85;[Rivera, Jason; Hare, Forrest]|[; ]|2014 6th International Conference On Cyber Conflict (CyCon 2014)|2014|||99-116|10.1109/cycon.2014.6916398|pub.1095348280|1;[]|[]||2013||||10.1017/cbo9781139169288|pub.1108525108|136"

Conflict in cyberspace is constantly evolving and deterrence might provide stability and understanding of these conflicts. Because of the speed at which cyber attacks can occur and the rate at which they can spread, it is important to understand how countries using cyber weapons frame the problem. The method used in this paper is controlled comparison of three different cyber attacks: the 2007 attacks on Estonia, the Stuxnet attack on Iran, and the LulzSec attacks multiple targets in 2011. These three events bore the similarity that defenders could not immediately attribute the attack to an actor. This attribution problem influenced how the defenders responded to the problem. Upon further research, however, it became apparent that attribution was not the defenders' biggest problem in two of the three cases. Attribution may not always be immediately available through technical means, but eventually defenders had enough information on which to act. At this point, other problems arose, like escalating a cyber conflict with a far more powerful neighbor or determining how to respond without a cyber capability of one's own. These cases demonstrate attribution is a necessary but not sufficient cause for responding to a cyber attack and that defenders have many response options available, from technical defense of their networks to escalation of the conflict to kinetic military strikes. Additionally, cyber deterrence does not require the high levels of attribution that some theorists argue. Instead, a counterattack can rely on a lower level of attribution because the target is typically a known adversary and because the results from a cyber attack are generally much lower than the effects from a kinetic attack.",,2015,,,,"Detlefsen, William R",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091739443,0,

This book fills a large gap in the scholarly literature on nuclear deterrence. Much of what we know about nuclear strategy is based on studies of the Soviet Union and the United States. This book uniquely analyzes the nuclear postures of regional powers such as India and Pakistan. It identifies three postures that these states can conceivably choose, develops a unique theory to explain posture adoption outcomes, and analyzes how each posture influences conventional deterrence.

pub.1114770567,10.11375/kokusaiseiji.180_98,欧州の核不拡散と東アジアの核拡散の因果関係,"This article explores the mutual interaction of nuclear nonproliferation negotiations in Europe and nuclear nonproliferation negotiations in East Asia in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Previous studies separately surveyed European nuclear proliferation and East Asian nuclear proliferation. These studies,however, focusing on one specific area respectively cannot completely answer the question as to why the Soviet Union and the United States changed their nuclear policies as well as to why the results of the nuclear nonproliferation negotiations in Europe and East Asia became symmetric. This is because there is a clear fact that the Soviet Union supported Chinese nuclear development and the United States planned NATO nuclear sharing and the MLF, which partly allowed West Germany to “possess” nuclear weapons at first. In order to answer these questions adequately, I treat both areas’ nonproliferation negotiations as a series of negotiation and show a new hypothesis that the Chinese nuclear issue was dealt promptly to settle the West German nuclear issues. The Soviet Union, which greatly feared that West Germany would acquire nuclear weapons, indicated that it would discourage Chinese nuclear development in return for the United States to do the same regarding West Germany’s nuclear policy. The Soviet Union promoted building trust with the United States and succeeded with the result of West Germany ratifying the PTBT and the NPT. In contrast to Europe, East Asia failed in achieving nuclear nonproliferation. What are the causes of such a symmetric outcome? West Germany and China both needed nuclear deterrence for their national security, especially against threat from the Soviet Union and/or United States. The United States offered West Germany security assurance and kept mutual confidence, but the Soviet Union unilaterally demanded that China abandoned its nuclear development in order to promote nuclear nonproliferation negotitations with the United States without any compensation. This act resulted in losing China’s trust because the Soviet Union’s top priority was to stop West Germany, and thus treated China’s nuclear issues as one of the means to achieve this goal. Does settling West Germany’s nuclear issue in the form of mutual cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union indicate that their negotiations were excellent? If we turn our eyes towards the correlation between European negotiations and East Asian negotiations, we can understand that they are not necessarily superior negotiations like non-cooperative games which all countries gain profit, but rather,unequal negotiations that the cost for the agreement in Europe was passed to negotiations in East Asia, and the European negotiation became one of the causes of the failure of nonproliferation in East Asia.",International Relations,2015,2015,180,180_98-180_110,"清久, 芝井",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1114770567,0,"[Colton, TimothyJ.]|[]|Canadian-American Slavic Studies|1980|14|4|577-578|10.1163/221023980x00265|pub.1001120387|1;[Embree, George D.]|[]|The Soviet Union and the German Question September 1958 – June 1961|1963|||120-127|10.1007/978-94-015-2749-1_18|pub.1020083247|1"

Plutonium produced as a by-product in nuclear reactor fuel, especially in fuel discharged at low burn-up (1 to 2 MWd/kg), is potentially weapons usable material. In the event of plutonium interdiction from a smuggling act, its origin has to be established through nuclear forensics attribution methods before any response is initiated against this malicious act. The characteristics of separated plutonium from discharged reactor fuel and the associated fission product traces depend on factors such as the reactor type (thermal or fast reactor), fuel burn-up, irradiation history, and the chemical process used to separate plutonium. A new methodology of using trace fission product to plutonium ratios for nuclear forensics attribution of plutonium to the type of reactor used for its production is presented along with results obtained for case studies of a fast neutron spectrum breeder reactor and a thermal neutron spectrum reactor using open literature design information of these two types of nuclear reactors.",Science & Global Security,2015,23,1,48-67,"Chirayath, Sunil S.; Osborn, Jeremy M.; Coles, Taylor M.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043328296,13,

Nichols advocates a new strategy of minimum deterrence that includes deep unilateral reductions to the US nuclear arsenal, a no-first-use pledge, withdrawing US tactical nuclear weapons from Europe, and ending extended nuclear deterrence for allies. The weakest part of his argument eschews nuclear retaliation against small nuclear states that attack the United States, opting instead to use only conventional weapons to guarantee regime change. He admits this will entail enormous cost and sacrifice, but cites the “immorality” of retaliating against a smaller power with few targets worthy of nuclear weaponry, which totally ignores the massive underground facilities constructed to shield military facilities in many of these states.

Despite the US extended nuclear deterrence for its security, a sizable section of the people in South Korea have started debating if their country can revisit the nuclear option as a deterrent to North Korea's continued threats. Several law makers have started articulating such a view. Several opinion polls held recently also endorse such a view. However, the US is unlikely to allow South Korea to take the nuclear path as it would have serious consequences not only for the region but also the world. China would also not rejoice with the prospect of having another nuclear power in its neighborhood. If South Korea goes nuclear, Japan and Taiwan will find it difficult to resist having their own nuclear weapons. To stem such a trend, it becomes all the more necessary for the international community to address the issue of denuclearizing North Korea. The suspended Six-Party-Talks ought to restart soon and China has a great role in reigning in Pyongyang. Fortunately, the government in South Korea has not supported the view of the country going nuclear. But if the security situation deteriorates further, it might become irresistible for the government to have a rethink, with an inevitable domino effect in Japan and Taiwan soon.This article makes an in-depth study of the prevailing trend in South Korea, the views of some influential law makers pleading for the country to go nuclear, various public opinions polls, possible US stance and implications that such a change in policy would have on the region's security situation and the author's assessment based on the critical examination of the above-mentioned factors.

pub.1102423214,10.2139/ssrn.2551553,Liberal Democracy and Nuclear Despotism: Two Ethical Foreign Policy Dilemmas,"This article advances a critical analysis of John Rawls’s justification of liberal democratic nuclear deterrence in the post-Cold War era as found in The Law of Peoples. Rawls’s justification overlooked how nuclear-armed liberal democracies are ensnared in two intransigent ethical dilemmas: one in which the mandate to secure liberal constitutionalism requires both the preservation and violation of important constitutional provisions in domestic affairs, and the other in which this same mandate requires both the preservation and violation of the liberal commitment to international legal arrangements and to the rule of law generally. On this view, the choice to violate constitutional provisions and international legal arrangements is evidence of nuclear despotism. Moreover, this choice does not imply that the ethical foreign policy dilemmas were resolved. Instead, it implies that the dilemmas force liberal democratic governments into implementing ethically paradoxical policy outcomes.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2015,,,,"Doyle, Thomas E.",Texas State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102423214,0,

They tend to believe that the U.S is always on the right side of any conflict. This is particularly prevalent in discussions of terrorism. Terrorism is what the “bad guys” do and fighting terrorists is what we, the “good guys,” do. The goal of this paper is to present a Socratic strategy to challenge these assumptions. This approach involves showing that a popular conception of terrorism entails the conclusion that nuclear deterrence is itself a form of terrorism. I call this “the terrorist problem for deterrence.” When students are presented with the deterrence problem, they must either reject the conclusion that terrorism is always wrong or that U.S foreign policy is always right. Presenting students with this dilemma leads them to a more complex perspective regarding the ethics of war and peace.",Teaching Ethics,2015,15,2,277-286,"Stout, J.

What deterrence basically comes down to is making clear to any potential opponent that if you dare to attack me, you may expect, at a minimum, a reply in kind that will be devastating to your potential. It also includes the message that even if attacked my capacity to make such a reply will be preserved in a guaranteed second strike, so a first strike will not give any advantage. With regard to nuclear weapons the ICJ considered deterrence but did not conclude that the threat or use of nuclear weapons, which was the deterrent threat, was contrary to public international law in cases where the survival of the state was at stake. This is the reason to see whether indeed a parallel can be drawn between the deterrent strategies in the nuclear realm and a perceived cyber attack by a state in cyberspace and projected generic (preventive) replies by states to such threats, or attacks. Is such a deterrent strategy viable? Would importing deterrence in the cyber realm improve cyber security? And how does public international law qualify such deterrent strategy (is it in accordance with public international law)? These and other legal questions are prompted by the technological developments in the digital area that have created the possibilities for its use as new weapons.",Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace,2015,,,284-304,"Myjer, Eric",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046929106,0,

Previously, ‘mainstream’ strategic analysts typically avoided overt attention to normative questions, preferring to concentrate on the alleged psychological or military foundations of deterrence theory. Public commentators who did raise normative issues all too often did so only at the fringes, debating the virtues of pacifism or the implications of simple “red versus dead” declarations. Of course there had long been analysts who insisted on raising more subtle and complex normative issues, but their impact was limited. In the past few years, however, normative issues have been brought front and center and knitted inextricably into the traditional political and military context.

The balance of military strength plays virtually no role in standard accounts of brinkmanship. But this is largely by assumption and seems incompatible with an apparent trade-off between power and risk that decision makers have faced in some actual crises. This paper incorporates this trade-off in a modified model of nuclear brinkmanship. A main result is that the more likely the balance of resolve is to favor a defender, the less military power a challenger brings to bear. The model also formalizes the stability-instability paradox, showing that a less stable strategic balance, that is, a sharper trade-off between power and risk, makes conflict at high levels of violence less likely but conflict at lower levels more likely. The analysis also helps explain the incentives different states have to adopt different nuclear doctrines and force postures.",International Organization,2015,69,3,589-626,"Powell, Robert",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028216003,10,"[Hoyt, Timothy D.]|[]|Asian Survey|2001|41|6|956-977|10.1525/as.2001.41.6.956|pub.1002196983|9;[Narang, Vipin]|[ur.015524123107.00]|International Security|2010|34|3|38-78|10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38|pub.1003337139|34;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|Security Studies|1994|3|3|509-520|10.1080/09636419409347560|pub.1005953881|3;[Kapur, S.

But, how valid are such perceptions? This book seeks to address this question and assesses the region’s nuclear security from two principal standpoints. First, it evaluates the robustness of the Indo-Pakistani mutual deterrence by analysing the strength and weaknesses of the competing arguments regarding the issue. It also analyses the causes and consequences of nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan, the nature of deterrence structure in the region and the challenges of confidence building and arms control between the two countries in order to assess the robustness of South Asia’s nuclear deterrence. Second, it assesses the safety and security of the nuclear assets and nuclear infrastructure of India and Pakistan. The author holds that the debate on South Asia’s nuclear security is largely misplaced because the optimists tend to overemphasise the stabilising effects of nuclear weapons and the pessimists are too alarmists. It is argued that while the risks of nuclear weapons are significant, it is unlikely that India and Pakistan will give up their nuclear arsenals in the foreseeable future. Therefore, what needs to happen is that while nuclear elimination should be the long-term goal, in the interim years the two countries need to pursue minimum deterrence policies to reduce the likelihood of deterrence failure and the possibility of obtaining fissile materials by non-state actors.",,2014,,,,"Chakma, Bhumitra",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007899688,0,

However, the major aim of the article is to argue that constraints on conflict are insufficiently appreciated in the current discussion of the changing security order in the Asia-Pacific. In addition to conventional and nuclear deterrence, these constraints include: evidence of historical learning at the decision-making level; state agency at the regional level designed to shape and subdue major-power rivalries; new forms of economic interdependence; and the domestic political-economic priorities of the two main protagonists.

The paper addresses key trends and current thinking on nuclear deterrence, reviews recent research on nuclear weapons and coercion, develops testable hypotheses based on this literature, and explores these questions through analysis of North Korean and Pakistani nuclear capabilities, strategy, and doctrine, as well as instances of coercive escalation by both countries. The paper concludes by identifying common themes across the two cases and drawing implications for U.S. policy and military strategy.",,2014,,,,"Meyerle, Jerry; Gause, Ken; Ostovar, Afshon",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091555410,1,"[]|[]||2012||||10.21236/ada582894|pub.1091606055|12;[Gause, Ken E]|[ur.015722574422.90]||2013||||10.21236/ada581673|pub.1091736637|1"
pub.1042048001,10.1080/10736700.2014.1072990,India's Evolving Nuclear Posture,"This article analyzes India's nuclear doctrine, finding it to be critically flawed and inimical to strategic stability in South Asia. In pursuing an ambitious triad of nuclear forces, India is straying from the sensible course it charted after going overtly nuclear in 1998. In doing so, it is exacerbating the triangular nuclear dilemma stemming from India's simultaneous rivalries with China and Pakistan. Strategic instability is compounded by India's pursuit of conventional “proactive strategy options,” which have the potential to lead to uncontrollable nuclear escalation on the subcontinent. New Delhi should reaffirm and redefine its doctrine of minimum credible nuclear deterrence, based on small nuclear forces with sufficient redundancy and diversity to deter a first strike by either China or Pakistan. It should also reinvigorate its nuclear diplomacy and assume a leadership role in the evolving global nuclear weapon regime.",The Nonproliferation Review,2014,21,3-4,295-315,"Hagerty, Devin T.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042048001,1,

It means that it will try to miniaturize and modernize its warheads and missiles. This leads to a first-use doctrine of nuclear weapons. Obama's policy of engagement does not offer a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue as yet. In the context of its policy of critical engagement with the DPRK, the European Union has three key interests: regional peace and stability, denuclearization, and human rights. The Conference on Security and Cooperation (CSCE) could be a precedent. The CSCE process was based on three “baskets”: security, economics, and humanitarian. The multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership is a step in this regard. This article looks at three theoretical approaches: realism, liberal institutionalism, and liberal internationalism. It concludes that a political strategy to create a stable North Korean peninsula has to go beyond nuclear deterrence that is based on the realist notion of balance of power.",Defense and Security Analysis,2014,30,4,336-345,"Gaertner, Heinz",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050286403,1,
pub.1091778157,10.21236/ada617308,Deterring Iran's Use of Offensive Cyber: A Case Study,"Since 2011, Iran and the United States have been engaged in a low-level cyber conflict. Iranian cyber forces and cyber proxies have launched distributed denial of service (DDoS), web defacement, spear phishing, and data manipulation attacks against U.S. and allied banks, media outlets, government offices, social networking sites, and military communications networks. These attacks pose critical questions for U.S. entities with cyber roles and missions. Can Iran be deterred from engaging in offensive cyber? If so, how? What would a deterrence strategy that targets Iran s use of offensive cyber look like? This paper explores how the concept of tailored deterrence could be applied to Iran in the cyber sphere. Utilizing a case-studies approach, it analyzes some of the unique features associated with the regime s political and military decision making processes, how its cyber programs and entities are structured and affiliated with the regime, the TTP that these entities employ, their relative capabilities, and how these factors could play in a cyber-deterrence scenario.",,2014,,,,"Connell, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091778157,0,
pub.1035787379,10.1111/ajps.12082,Signaling Alliance Commitments: Hand‐Tying and Sunk Costs in Extended Nuclear Deterrence,"How can states signal their alliance commitments? Although scholars have developed sophisticated theoretical models of costly signaling in international relations, we know little about which specific policies leaders can implement to signal their commitments. This article addresses this question with respect to the extended deterrent effects of nuclear weapons. Can nuclear states deter attacks against their friends by simply announcing their defense commitments? Or must they deploy nuclear weapons on a protégé's territory before an alliance is seen as credible? Using a new dataset on foreign nuclear deployments from 1950 to 2000, our analysis reveals two main findings. First, formal alliances with nuclear states appear to carry significant deterrence benefits. Second, however, stationing nuclear weapons on a protégé's territory does not bolster these effects. The analysis yields new insights about the dynamics of “hand-tying” and “sunk cost” signals in international politics.",American Journal of Political Science,2014,58,4,919-935,"Fuhrmann, Matthew; Sechser, Todd S.",Texas A&M University System; University of Virginia,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035787379,44,"[Sechser, Todd S.]|[ur.014117123173.26]|Conflict Management and Peace Science|2011|28|4|377-401|10.1177/0738894211413066|pub.1001473149|30;[Debs, Alexandre; Monteiro, Nuno P.]|[ur.015751046734.35; ur.07512042154.88]|International Organization|2014|68|1|1-31|10.1017/s0020818313000192|pub.1002612943|54;[Gibler, Douglas M.; Vasquez, John A.]|[ur.013500426641.71; ]|International Studies Quarterly|1998|42|4|785-807|10.1111/0020-8833.00106|pub.1002671585|38;[Narang, Vipin]|[ur.015524123107.00]|International Security|2010|34|3|38-78|10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38|pub.1003337139|34;[Hersman, Rebecca K.

pub.1030773001,10.1016/j.actaastro.2014.06.023,China׳s space development history: A comparison of the rocket and satellite sectors,"China is the most recent great power to emerge in aerospace. It has become the first developing nation to achieve some measure of aerospace production capability across the board. Outside the developed aerospace powers, only China has demonstrated competence concerning all aspects of a world-class aerospace industry: production of advanced rockets, satellites, and aircraft and of their supporting engineering, materials, and systems. As an emerging great power during the Cold War, China was still limited in resources, technology access, and capabilities. It thereby faced difficult choices and constraints. Yet it achieved increasing, though uneven, technological levels in different aerospace sub-sectors. Explaining this variance can elucidate challenges and opportunities confronting developing nations sharing limitations that previously constrained China.Rockets (missiles and space launch vehicles/SLVs) and satellites (military and civilian) were two areas of early achievement for China, and represent this article׳s two in-depth case studies. Initial import of American and Soviet knowledge and technology, coupled with national resources focused under centralized leadership, enabled China to master missiles and satellites ahead of other systems. Early in the Cold War, great power status hinged on atomic development. China devoted much of its limited technical resources to producing nuclear weapons in order to “prevent nuclear blackmail,” “break the superpowers׳ monopoly,” and thereby secure great power status. Beijing׳s second strategic priority was to develop reliable ballistic missiles to credibly deliver warheads, thereby supporting nuclear deterrence. Under Chairman Mao Zedong׳s direction and the guidance of the American-educated Dr. Qian Xuesen (H.S. Tsien), missile development became China׳s top aerospace priority. Satellites were also prioritized for military-strategic reasons and because they could not be purchased from abroad following the Sino-Soviet split. By the Cold War׳s end, China had achieved comprehensive rocket and satellite capabilities. Today it is pursuing cutting-edge systems in both areas, continuing formidable indigenous development while absorbing foreign technology where possible. To understand the reasons for China׳s aerospace development trajectory it is necessary to consider closely its specific history and larger context.The article will therefore examine the decision-making, organization, and technological development that made such progress possible.2",Acta Astronautica,2014,103,,142-167,"Erickson, Andrew S.",Naval War College; Harvard University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030773001,6,

In this game, a rational choice for each of the players is ""cooperation.""

Yet the utility of India's nuclear weapons remains questionable on many grounds. Nuclear deterrence is dubious in general and especially dubious in the subcontinent. Nuclear weapons are not usable as weapons of compellence or defence. They failed to stop the Pakistani incursion in Kargil in 1999 or the terrorist attack on Mumbai in 2008. They will not help India to shape the military calculations of likely enemies. And India's global status and profile will be determined far more crucially by its economic performance than nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, they do impose direct and opportunity costs economically, risk corrosion of democratic accountability, add to global concerns about nuclear terrorism, and have not helped the cause of global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Because the consequences of a limited regional war involving India could be catastrophic for the world, others have both the right and a responsibility to engage with the issue. For all these reasons, a denuclearized world that includes the destruction of India's nuclear stockpile would favourably affect the balance of India's security and other interests, national and international interests, and material interests and value goals.",International Affairs,2014,90,5,1101-1124,"THAKUR, RAMESH",Australian National University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047383027,0,

While this article does not aim to entirely refute this assertion, it suggests that the failure to successfully employ cyber deterrence is not determined by the technical challenges of cyberspace, but rather that the effects of these challenges are mediated through social context(s) and norms. To present this, I elaborate on the meaning of cyber deterrence and suggest that a rethinking of this term allows us to better address the various actors involved in the practices of cyber deterrence, as well as to better describe the intersections between the cyber and kinetic means affecting these practices. Building on the concept of cyber deterrence and borrowing from the constructivist approach to International Relations, I focus on how anonymity and “violence” are affected by social constructions and norms and in turn influence the success or failure of cyber deterrence.

pub.1054010627,10.1017/s0260210513000351,Secession and the invisible hand of the international system,"Abstract This article argues that 1945 constitutes an historical inflection point from a period of state expansion to state contraction and that this transformation is primarily the result of changes at the international level. Just as security and economic pressures drove lead states to expand in earlier times, changing conditions in the post-1945 period led to a contraction in state size. The change from multipolarity, the development of the territorial integrity norm, the shift to nuclear deterrence, and the burgeoning global economy contributed to the milieu in which states evaluate the costs and benefits of holding territory, and this has enabled states to permit secession more frequently. The result has been an increase in the rate of peaceful secession and a corresponding proliferation in the number of sovereign states.

Can the same be said about the IBSA states’ position in the international security hierarchy? After locating the IBSA coalition in the shifting world order, we analyze its member states’ willingness and capacity to coordinate their security policies and build a common global security agenda. In addition, we explore the state of and perspectives on bi- and trilateral collaboration initiatives on defense and armaments between India, Brazil and South Africa. A key reason for the mostly modest results of global security agenda coordination and cross-regional defense collaboration is that the prevailing security concerns of each country are located at the regional level. Therefore, the starting point of an assessment of the prospects of IBSA’s security cooperation and its potential impact on the strategic global landscape has to be a comparative evaluation of the regional security environments, focusing on overlaps and potential synergies between the national security policies of the three state actors.   RESUMO No decorrer da década passada os estados do IBAS (Índia, Brasil e África do Sul) aumentaram seu respectivo peso na ordem internacional em transição, especialmente em assuntos econômicos. O mesmo pode ser dito em relação à posição desses estados na hierarquia de segurança internacional? O texto situa a coalizão IBAS na ordem internacional em transição e, em seguida, analisa as disposições e capacidades de seus estados membros de coordenar suas políticas de segurança e de construir uma agenda comum de segurança global. Adicionalmente, são exploradas a situação e as perspectivas de iniciativas de colaboração bi e trilateral em defesa e armamentos entre a Índia, o Brasil e a África do Sul. Uma razão fundamental para os resultados predominantemente modestos de coordenação da agenda de segurança global e de colaboração inter-regional de defesa é que as preocupações prioritárias desses países em termos de segurança se situam no nível regional. Assim, o ponto de partida para uma avaliação das prospectivas de cooperação em segurança do IBAS no terreno da estratégia global deve ser um balanço dos contextos de segurança regional, focado em superposições e sinergias potenciais entre as políticas nacionais de segurança dos três estados.   Keywords : India, Brazil, South Africa; IBSA Dialogue Forum; security policies, security context, security cooperation; military power, armament; nuclear deterrence; soft-balancing Palavras-chave : Índia, Brasil, África do Sul; Fórum de Diálogo IBSA; políticas de segurança, contexto de segurança, cooperação em segurança; poder militar, armamentos; distensão nuclear; reequilíbrio suave   DOI 10.12957/rmi.2014.10863 Recebido em 30 de Abril de 2014 /  Received on  April 30, 2014 Aceito em 20 de Maio de 2014 / Accepted on May 20, 2014.",Mural Internacional,2014,5,1,10-27,"Flemes, Daniel; Vaz, Alcides Costa",University of Brasília,Brazil,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064768304,2,"[Panda, Jagannath P.]|[ur.012234773457.46]|Strategic Analysis|2013|37|3|299-304|10.1080/09700161.2013.782631|pub.1042267991|2;[Mitra, Subrata K.]|[ur.016663705337.25]|Contemporary South Asia|2003|12|3|399-417|10.1080/0958493032000175914|pub.1043159342|20;[Pape, Robert A.]|[]|International Security|2005|30|1|7-45|10.1162/0162288054894607|pub.1053612063|283;[NOLTE, DETLEF]|[]|Review of International Studies|2010|36|4|881-901|10.1017/s026021051000135x|pub.1053821777|128;[Friedberg, Aaron L.]|[]|International Security|1993|18|3|5|10.2307/2539204|pub.1069980759|253;[]|[]|Choice|2009|46|12|46-7061-46-7061|10.5860/choice.46-7061|pub.1073433189|107;[Huntington, Samuel P.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1999|78|2|35|10.2307/20049207|pub.1102764297|198"
pub.1020200103,10.1016/j.cogsys.2013.08.001,Nuclear deterrence and the logic of deliberative mindreading,"Although the computational modeling of “mindreading” (e.g., believing that you believe that there’s a deadly boa in the box, Smith mindreadingly predicts that you will refrain from removing the top) is well-established, this success has been achieved primarily in connection with scenarios that, relatively speaking, are both simple and common. Herein, we introduce a new computational-logic framework that allows formalization of mindreading of a rather more demanding sort: viz., deliberative multi-agent mindreading, applied to the realm of nuclear strategy. This form of mindreading, in this domain, is both complex and uncommon: it for example can quickly involve at least formulae reflecting fifth-order beliefs, and requires precise deductive reasoning over such iterated beliefs. In addition, the relevant models and simulations involve three, four, five agents, and sometimes many more. In the nuclear-strategy realm, for example, the better kind of modeling, simulation, and prediction (MSP) that our framework is intended to enable, should ultimately be capable of formalizing, at once, the arbitrarily iterated beliefs of at least every civilized nation on Earth. Based on our modeling, we present a set of desiderata that any modeling framework should satisy to be able to capture deliberative multi-agent mindreading in domains such as nuclear deterrence. Using our desiderata, we evaluate game theory, metagame theory, digital games, and tabletop games when used to model nuclear deterrence. Finally, we consider and rebut possible objections to our modeling paradigm and conclude with a map of ongoing and future work.",Cognitive Systems Research,2014,28,,20-43,"Bringsjord, Selmer; Govindarajulu, Naveen Sundar; Ellis, Simon; McCarty, Evan; Licato, John",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020200103,9,"[Chavez, Alex; Zhang, Jun]|[ur.01160731640.94; ]|Social Computing, Behavioral Modeling, and Prediction|2008|||229-238|10.1007/978-0-387-77672-9_25|pub.1008468332|1;[Bringsjord, Selmer]|[ur.01107737534.07]|The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology|2001|||127-169|10.1017/cbo9780511816772.008|pub.1009204010|23;[]|[]|Computers & Mathematics with Applications|1995|29|3|115|10.1016/0898-1221(95)90101-9|pub.1016882847|732;[Arkoudas, Konstantine; Bringsjord, Selmer]|[ur.012662745044.40; ur.01107737534.07]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2008|5351||17-29|10.1007/978-3-540-89197-0_6|pub.1020848268|10;[Lorini, Emiliano; Moisan, Frédéric]|[ur.014226702125.24; ur.013233103073.11]|Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science|2011|278||245-260|10.1016/j.entcs.2011.10.019|pub.1025471849|6;[Gentzen, Gerhard]|[ur.011400131711.37]|Mathematische Zeitschrift|1935|39|1|176-210|10.1007/bf01201353|pub.1026582422|1116;[]|[]||2007||||10.1007/978-1-4020-5587-4|pub.1028654675|109;[Brandenburger, Adam]|[]|The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|2008|||1-13|10.1057/978-1-349-95121-5_2642-1|pub.1031853466|5;[Bourbaki, Nicolas]|[]||2004||||10.1007/978-3-642-59309-3|pub.1032451702|37;[Andréka, Hajnal; Madarász, Judit X.; Németi, István]|[ur.01226135137.09; ur.01160021737.27; ur.010613126625.17]|Handbook of Spatial Logics|2007|||607-711|10.1007/978-1-4020-5587-4_11|pub.1037714724|25;[Stickel, Mark; Waldinger, Richard; Lowry, Michael; Pressburger, Thomas; Underwood, Ian]|[ur.012732136153.38; ur.010633737601.27; ur.015245536343.80; ur.013652575343.29; ur.014747630157.36]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1994|814||341-355|10.1007/3-540-58156-1_24|pub.1039328301|75;[Andréka, Hajnal; Madarász, Judit X.; Németi, István; Székely, Gergely]|[ur.01226135137.09; ur.01160021737.27; ur.010613126625.17; ur.01274250337.76]|Synthese|2012|186|3|633-649|10.1007/s11229-011-9914-8|pub.1041902885|23;[Ebbinghaus, H.-D.; Flum, J.; Thomas, W.]|[ur.014633210307.47; ur.01075037745.51; ]||1994||||10.1007/978-1-4757-2355-7|pub.1042209476|234;[Bringsjord, Selmer; Govindarajulu, Naveen Sundar]|[ur.01107737534.07; ur.014276765743.65]|Studies in Applied Philosophy, Epistemology and Rational Ethics|2013|5||151-165|10.1007/978-3-642-31674-6_11|pub.1046721715|14;[Francez, Nissim; Dyckhoff, Roy]|[ur.012761654533.98; ur.015744547530.18]|Linguistics and Philosophy|2010|33|6|447-477|10.1007/s10988-011-9088-3|pub.1050119105|32;[Kreisel, G.]|[ur.015372335637.43]|Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics|1971|63||109-170|10.1016/s0049-237x(08)70845-0|pub.1050792876|53;[Bringsjord, Selmer]|[ur.01107737534.07]|Journal of Applied Logic|2008|6|4|502-525|10.1016/j.jal.2008.09.001|pub.1051630694|14;[]|[]|Computers & Mathematics with Applications|1996|32|6|134|10.1016/s0898-1221(96)90245-x|pub.1053742807|12;[Cooper, Russell; DeJong, Douglas V.; Forsythe, Robert; Ross, Thomas W.]|[ur.0736717074.06; ur.01005032274.04; ur.01252501440.96; ur.016625676103.71]|Games and Economic Behavior|1996|12|2|187-218|10.1006/game.1996.0013|pub.1054488072|208;[Deutsch, Morton]|[ur.010042577353.01]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1958|2|4|265-279|10.1177/002200275800200401|pub.1063625683|1136;[Rosinger, Kurt Edward; Woodger, J.

pub.1050553176,10.1002/rhc3.12058,Public Perspectives on Nuclear Security,"Employing data from two dozen national surveys of the American people conducted between 1993 and 2011, we analyze trends in mass views on key dimensions of nuclear security. We specifically address four questions. (a) How are the risks of nuclear conflict and further nuclear proliferation assessed? (b) How does the public view the relevance and value of US nuclear weapons? (c) What future directions are preferred for the US nuclear weapons stockpile? (d) How are public views about retaining US nuclear weapons structured? Our data show that nuclear conflict with Iran and North Korea and the risks of nuclear weapons or materials being acquired by transnational terrorist groups are seen as the greatest nuclear threats. Most Americans continue to value the efficacy of nuclear deterrence, consider nuclear abolition to be desirable but not yet feasible, and support modest mutual reductions in nuclear weapons. Employing causal modeling, we find that mass beliefs about the importance of retaining US nuclear weapons are hierarchically structured in coherent ways, and therefore are likely to be both resilient and relevant to policy debates on nuclear security.",Risk Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy,2014,5,2,109-133,"Herron, Kerry G.; Jenkins‐Smith, Hank C.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050553176,5,"[Herron, Kerry G.; Jenkins–Smith, Hank C.]|[ur.01017155444.18; ur.014246431371.12]|International Studies Quarterly|2002|46|4|451-479|10.1111/1468-2478.t01-1-00242|pub.1002259580|15;[Wlezien, Christopher]|[ur.012721734345.20]|Electoral Studies|2005|24|4|555-579|10.1016/j.electstud.2005.01.009|pub.1009189823|230;[Jenkins-Smith, Hank C.; Mitchell, Neil J.; Herron, Kerry G.]|[ur.014246431371.12; ur.015030265441.40; ur.01017155444.18]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2004|48|3|287-309|10.1177/0022002704264214|pub.1028142664|22;[Walter, Lippmann]|[]|The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|1923|57|1|100|10.1097/00005053-192301000-00118|pub.1038083615|408;[Lupia, Arthur]|[ur.011311743201.54]|American Political Science Review|1994|88|1|63-76|10.2307/2944882|pub.1039302592|768;[Fiske, Susan T.]|[ur.01034403033.91]|Annual Review of Psychology|1993|44|1|155-194|10.1146/annurev.ps.44.020193.001103|pub.1047669500|402;[Oppermann, Kai; Viehrig, Henrike]|[ur.013204130547.49; ur.07371061607.43]|West European Politics|2009|32|5|925-942|10.1080/01402380903064804|pub.1047874582|21;[Jones, Michael D.; Jenkins‐Smith, Hank C.]|[ur.015600143542.93; ur.014246431371.12]|Policy Studies Journal|2009|37|1|37-58|10.1111/j.1541-0072.2008.00294.x|pub.1048106104|82;[MEERNIK, JAMES; AULT, MICHAEL]|[ur.01260032211.69; ur.014545655061.47]|American Politics Research|2001|29|4|352-373|10.1177/1532673x01029004002|pub.1048651999|14;[Wittkopf, Eugene R.]|[ur.0773160760.74]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1994|38|3|376-401|10.1177/0022002794038003002|pub.1054033839|25;[Almond, Gabriel A.]|[]|Public Opinion Quarterly|1956|20|2|371|10.1086/266634|pub.1058577247|30;[CONVERSE, P.

To the contrary, a certain degree of overlap between nuclear deterrence and cyber conflicts is a plausible expectation for several reasons. First, future deterrent challenges will include regional nuclear arms races accompanied by competition in information technology and other aspects of advanced conventional command-control and precision strike systems. Second, cyber-attacks may be used against opposed nuclear command-control systems and weapons platforms as well as against infrastructure for the purpose of mass disruption during a crisis or war. Third, cyber capabilities support escalation dominance or escalation control, depending on the objectives of states and on the transparency of identification for cyber friends and foes.",Comparative Strategy,2014,33,3,279-286,"Cimbala, Stephen J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015024870,2,

These states have small nuclear arsenals, often face multiple active conflicts, and sometimes have weak institutions. How do these nuclear states—and potential future ones—manage their nuclear forces and influence international conflict? Examining the reasoning and deterrence consequences of regional power nuclear strategies, this book demonstrates that these strategies matter greatly to international stability and it provides new insights into conflict dynamics across important areas of the world such as the Middle East, East Asia, and South Asia. The book identifies the diversity of regional power nuclear strategies and describes in detail the posture each regional power has adopted over time. Developing a theory for the sources of regional power nuclear strategies, the book offers the first systematic explanation of why states choose the postures they do and under what conditions they might shift strategies. It then analyzes the effects of these choices on a state's ability to deter conflict. Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis, the book shows that, contrary to a bedrock article of faith in the canon of nuclear deterrence, the acquisition of nuclear weapons does not produce a uniform deterrent effect against opponents. Rather, some postures deter conflict more successfully than others. This book considers the range of nuclear choices made by regional powers and the critical challenges they pose to modern international security.",,2014,,,,"Narang, Vipin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110733626,1,

In principle, conventional deterrence can be used to buy the time required for such stabilization efforts.

pub.1046991008,10.1111/1468-2346.12129,Waiting for Kant: devaluing and delegitimizing nuclear weapons,"Expectations of significant progress towards a nuclear weapons-free world continue to shape global nuclear politics. Progress towards nuclear disarmament will require diminishing the value of nuclear weapons to the point where it becomes politically, strategically and socially acceptable for nuclear-armed states to relinquish permanently their nuclear arsenals. Key to this are the concepts and processes of ‘devaluing’ and ‘delegitimizing’ nuclear weapons that have steadily coalesced in global nuclear discourse since the mid-1990s. This article builds on current research by developing three images of nuclear disarmament under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT): ‘surface’ devaluing, ‘deep’ devaluing, and delegitimizing nuclear weapons. The first represents codification by the nuclear-weapon states of the transformation of the Cold War environment through reductions in the size and role of nuclear arsenals that leaves the logic of nuclear deterrence and nuclear prestige largely unchanged. Deep devaluing is framed as a reconceptualization of the political, strategic and military logics that underpin nuclear-weapons policies and practices. Delegitimizing represents a more radical normative project to transform collective meanings assigned to nuclear weapons. The analysis examines conceptions of devaluing nuclear weapons from the perspective of non-nuclear weapon states and the relationship between devaluing nuclear weapons and the idea of a spectrum of nuclear deterrence. It concludes by highlighting the tension between surface and deep devaluing, the emergence of a delegitimizing agenda, and the political implications for the current NPT review cycle set to culminate in the next quinquennial Review Conference in 2015.",International Affairs,2014,90,3,601-623,"RITCHIE, NICK",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046991008,10,

Indeed, complementing politico-strategic thinking with ethical categories could significantly strengthen the abolitionist call. To fill the gap, this article analyzes the evolution of the nuclear ethics of the Roman Catholic Church and especially its position on nuclear deterrence. If this strategy was granted interim and strictly conditioned moral acceptance during the Cold War, nuclear deterrence is today increasingly considered ineffective, an obstacle to genuine disarmament, and hence morally unjustifiable. In the new security context, the conditions for the Catholic Church's “interim nuclear ethics” have altered, and nuclear disarmament has become a feasible option and an alternative strategy to deterrence.",The Nonproliferation Review,2014,21,2,189-205,"Foradori, Paolo",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047021848,1,

We advance a portfolio theory of nuclear force structure, positing that states seek a diverse set of capabilities for nuclear deterrence, but that they also face major resource and organizational constraints. A number of factors may help to explain the portfolio of nuclear forces that states ultimately field, including resource availability, experience as a nuclear power, bureaucratic politics, the conventional threat environment, the presence of nuclear rivals, and the maintenance of nuclear alliances. We test the influence of these factors on force structure using a new data set of nuclear weapon platforms fielded by nine nuclear nations between 1950 and 2000.

pub.1015842020,10.1080/01495933.2013.840203,The North Korean Nuclear Threat to the U.S.,"A recent unclassified Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) assessment stated: “DIA assesses with moderate confidence the North [Korea] currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles.” This conclusion is highly credible and not really new. North Korea was assessed to have nuclear weapons long before the actual (or at least detected) first test of these weapons in 2006. Building a nuclear weapon small enough to be carried by the relatively large payloads of North Korea's ballistic missiles is not a very difficult task today. In light of what is now known about the proliferation of a nuclear missile warhead from China to Pakistan and from Pakistan to North Korea, the North Korea defector reports about nuclear weapons development and the North Korean nuclear tests, the DIA conclusion may be an understatement. The North Korean nuclear stockpile may be significantly greater than what is usually assessed. This is of concern because the North Korean regime is the most brutal Stalinist dictatorship in the world. Moreover, while North Korea has long made occasional nuclear attack threats against the U.S. in the past, the scope, magnitude, and frequency of these threats vastly increased in 2013. Current U.S. policy, which downgrades the importance of nuclear deterrence and cuts missile defense, is not well suited to handle this threat.",Comparative Strategy,2014,33,2,107-121,"Schneider, Mark",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015842020,0,

However, unlike the nuclear realm, cyber deterrence must incorporate a wide spectrum of potential adversaries of various skill, determination, and capability, ranging from individual actors to state run enterprises. What’s more, the very principles that achieved success in deterring the launch of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, namely the threat of severe retaliation, cannot be achieved in cyberspace, thus neutralizing the potential effectiveness of leveraging a similar strategy. Attribution challenges, the ability to respond quickly and effectively, and the ability to sustain a model of repeatability prove to be insurmountable in a domain where actors operate in obfuscation.",Journal of Strategic Security,2014,7,1,54-67,"Iasiello, Emilio",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072564829,13,

Strategic nonnuclear deterrence with the use of high-precision long-range weapons, which is considered as complementary to, rather than substituting for, strategic nuclear weapons, plays an increasingly important role. The effective strategic nonnuclear deterrence depends, to even a larger extent than nuclear deterrence, on the capacity of relevant information and communication infrastructure.

pub.1022671945,10.1080/09662839.2013.856304,"Transatlantic cooperation, alliance politics and extended deterrence: European perceptions of nuclear weapons","This article discusses the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) debate regarding American nonstrategic nuclear weapons (NSNW) in Europe, given the broad spectrum of views on nuclear issues when comparing individual member states. What is striking is the gap between public attitudes – which are broadly hostile to keeping NSNW in Europe – and elite opinion, which privileges the maintenance of NATO commitments to preserve alliance cohesion. To better understand this tension, this article dissects the elements of extended nuclear deterrence in Europe, addressing the difficulties associated with current nuclear-sharing arrangements. For some NATO states, the alliance's nuclear weapons are a political liability, since nuclear sharing clashes with international disarmament and nonproliferation commitments. For other NATO members, maintaining the status quo is preferable, as long as there is no alliance-wide consensus on the question of NSNW. These debates have been put to rest, for now, with NATO's Deterrence and Defense Posture Review, which reaffirmed the purpose of the alliance's nuclear weapons. However, these divisive debates point to more fundamental issues in alliance management, namely the credibility of American commitments, the sustainability of extended nuclear deterrence in Europe and the inevitable political tensions these questions provoke at the domestic level for NATO allies.",European Security,2014,23,1,1-14,"von Hlatky, Stéfanie",Queen's University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022671945,0,"[Jupille, J.; Caporaso, J.

What is the Russian de facto employment doctrine for this arsenal? This article argues that Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons (NSNW) have no defined mission and no deterrence framework has been elaborated for them.

Strategic “defensivism” emphasizes the overlapping and reinforcing impact of: (1) reductions in US, Russian and possibly other strategic nuclear forces, possibly down to the level of “minimum deterrence,” (2) deployment of improved strategic and/or theater antimissile defenses for the US, NATO allies and other partners; and (3) additional reliance on conventional military forces for some missions hitherto preferentially assigned to nuclear weapons. This article deals with the first two of these aspects only: the interaction between missile defenses and offensive force reductions in US–Russian strategy and policy. The findings are that stable deterrence as between the USA and Russia is possible at lower than New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty levels, but reductions below 1000 deployed long-range weapons for each state, toward a true minimum deterrent posture, will require multilateral as opposed to bilateral coordination of arms limitations. Missile defenses might provide some denial capability against light attacks by states with small arsenals, but they still fall short of meaningful damage limitation as between powers capable of massive nuclear strikes.",Defense and Security Analysis,2014,30,1,29-43,"Cimbala, Stephen J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016560178,0,

But—whether the context is major powers seeking to neutralise threats from each other (United States, Russia, China and India), non-nuclear allies seeking nuclear protection from various threat contingencies (Japan, South Korea and Australia) or vulnerable states seeking a ‘strategic equaliser’ (Pakistan and North Korea)—the traditional strategic arguments for nuclear deterrence are much weaker than they may first seem. Whatever may have been the case for the Cold War years, in today's world the risks associated with the acquisition or retention of nuclear weapons far outweigh any conceivable utility they may have. The financial arguments against them—that they are indefensibly costly—are strong. And the humanitarian arguments are overwhelming: nuclear weapons remain the most indiscriminately inhumane ever devised, and they should be outlawed as chemical and biological weapons have been. Making disarmament happen will never be easy, but—with the right political leadership—is not impossible.

Since the introduction of private security aboard shipping vessels the number of successful piracy attacks has steadily decreased. This begged the question, if the number of successful piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia has been decreasing since 2009, why are counter piracy actors calling for an increase in and expansion of current counter piracy efforts?

If, therefore, a state is able to reap the benefits of having a nuclear weapon without actually creating one, it will have no reason to forego membership in the Nonproliferation Treaty. Furthermore, states with latent nuclear weapon programs are already actively engaging in a form of “weaponless” nuclear deterrence. Far from existing only in imagination, the “virtual” arsenals of the future are already observable in the nuclear security strategies of non-nuclear weapon states today.

The paper offers a theoretical framework for measuring junior alliance partners’ perceptions of changes in the credibility of security guarantees due to changes in the capabilities, interests and reputation of the superpower. It addresses a gap in the nuclear nonproliferation literature, which does not conclusively indicate whether, and if so when, security assurances are effective in preventing proliferation.

Sometimes this phenomenon has been implicit, and at other times it has been explicit. From 1956 to around 1973, senior officials in both the civilian bureaucracy and the defense establishment had concluded that Australia should have nuclear weapons. This interest in the bomb was symptomatic of a period of nuclear disorder. Certain geopolitical circumstances meant Australia could not rely on its “great and powerful” friends for defending Australia and its interests in Southeast Asia. These circumstances began to change from the late 1960s to create a more benign security environment, and Canberra came to the conclusion that any major conventional or nuclear threat to Australia was also a threat to the United States, so Australia did not really need to play the deterrence game—Washington could take care of that complicated business. That combination of circumstances was the primary reason why Canberra gave up the nuclear option. However, the Asia-Pacific today is undergoing transformational geopolitical shifts that are beginning to seriously undermine the nuclear order underpinning Australia’s attachment to what is, compared to South Korea and Japan, a minimal serving of US extended nuclear deterrence (END). The operational aspects of US END were never articulated to Asian recipients, including Australian policy-makers, the way they were to European allies.",Australia and the Bomb,2014,,,1-10,"Leah, Christine M.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036592887,0,"[Gavin, Francis J.]|[ur.012732073475.73]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2012|35|4|573-600|10.1080/01402390.2012.715736|pub.1024904788|14;[Hymans, Jacques E.

However, for more than a decade, Australian thinking about nuclear weapons and strategy remained inchoate. Extended nuclear deterrence (END) as a concept in Australian strategic policy did not yet exist. Canberra was focused almost entirely on British defense policy, and any thinking about the role of nuclear weapons revolved around their tactical use in a war-fighting context, not their strategic utility as instruments of deterrence. Policy-makers first thought about the bomb in purely literal terms: how such weapons could be used against communist forces in Southeast Asia and to destroy forces attempting to invade Australia. There was no discussion of concepts that would guide the use of these weapons. This chapter identifies and examines the prevailing attitude of policy-makers, and how that view was shaped by the geopolitical circumstances at the time. It argues that Australian thinking about nuclear weapons developed primarily through the framework of thinking about Canberra’s strategic ties to Britain, and the idea of being a responsible contributor to the notion of “Empire defense.” Indeed, although Australia was aligned with the United States under the ANZUS Treaty, policy-makers did not think of it as a “nuclear” alliance until around 1956.",Australia and the Bomb,2014,,,11-28,"Leah, Christine M.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004133071,0,"[Williamson, Samuel R.; Rearden, Steven L.]|[ur.014336030225.48; ur.015700567400.98]||1993||||10.1007/978-1-137-05882-9|pub.1002169423|8;[Gowing, Margaret]|[]||1974||||10.1007/978-1-349-15529-3|pub.1012022096|46;[Horovitz, Liviu]|[ur.012332365035.69]|European Security|2014|23|1|73-89|10.1080/09662839.2013.846326|pub.1018233993|8;[Sauer, Tom]|[ur.010772770271.71]|European Security|2014|23|1|58-72|10.1080/09662839.2013.851675|pub.1028328006|1;[Duke, Simon]|[]||1987||||10.1007/978-1-349-18482-8|pub.1039223708|25;[REYNOLDS, WAYNE]|[]|The Historical Journal|1998|41|3|853-873|10.1017/s0018246x98007870|pub.1053771522|6;[Ball, Desmond]|[]|International Security|1982|7|3|31|10.2307/2538550|pub.1069980251|30"

According to the Conference’s media brief, its aim was “to provide an arena for the international community to have a facts-based discussion on the humanitarian and developmental consequences that would result from a nuclear weapon detonation. The Conference will be focusing on what happens on the ground”. Based on our analysis, the aims of the Oslo Conference spanned a broad spectrum, but in summary can be defined by three objectives: to advance the nuclear discourse, to include a diverse range of participants, and to do so without challenging the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Conference included 128 participants, including states, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and members of civil society.",,2013,,,,"Lewis, Patricia; Williams, Heather",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090208096,0,

Schelling have re-emphasized the utility of nuclear deterrence over nuclear nonproliferation (Waltz) and nuclear disarmament (Schelling). While the thrust of the articles is seemingly different, both are rooted in the same intellectual ground: an epistemology that assumes problem-free inferences, drawn from past experiences, are applicable in future scenarios; a foundational rooting in strategic rationality that entangles them in unsolvable contradictions concerning comparable risks of different nuclear constellations, namely deterrence versus proliferation and disarmament; and a bias in framing the empirical record that makes nuclear deterrence more conducive to security than nuclear disarmament. The common normative-practical denominator, then, is to let a nuclear weapon-free world appear both less desirable and less feasible than it might actually be.",The Nonproliferation Review,2013,20,3,545-565,"Müller, Harald",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036442962,4,

With the quantitative and qualificative improvements in nuclear stockpile, a proliferation-pessimism finds expression in metaphors about nuclear dominoes, chains etc. With a number of threshold states, the catch-phrase is ‘credible deterrence’. However, much of the zero-sum cold war thinking on strategic defence has now become anachronistic. A phased adaptive approach, leading to universal disarmament is necessary, especially in India’s strategic interest. A nuclear weapon-free world could ensure a safer regional security environment for India. It’s all the more imperative in view of China’s interest to emerge as the strategic leader in Asia, even well beyond Asia. New START initiatives are positive developments in this regard. However, it is necessary to bring into this fold other nuclear powers. (China has rejected the US and Russian levels of nuclear ‘transparency’ as part of its defence calculus; it has already crossed the multiple warhead Rubicon. It may also install a National Missile Defence System by 2020.) Though a Nuclear Weapon-Free World (NWFW) cannot emerge instantaneously, an NWFW can evolve, if the following measures are evolved: (i) Change the mind-set devaluing nuclear weapons by strategically displacing ‘disbelief’ with ‘faith’ in the efficacy of nuclear abolition. (ii) Change the perception of the utility and prestige associated with nuclear weapons. (iii) Redraft nuclear doctrines to restrict their role and break the ‘feed-back paradigm of the need for nuclear deterrence’. (iv) Take measures to build confidence in multilateral initiation on NWFW. (v) Ensure universal acceptance of ‘no first use’ (NFU) through a legally binding, universally accepted agreement. (vi) Have agreement prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. (vii) Devise agreements for controlling the continuous qualitative upgradation. (viii) Establishment of a Safeguard Regime with thorough organizational and institutional mechanism. (ix) Use advanced surveillance and monitoring technology to ensure compliance. (x) Implement effective enforcement strategy to penalize delinquent. It is in India’s interest to pursue universal disarmament with universal focus on economic and social cohesion for war prevention as the key to long-term security. As the first Asian country to build a nuclear reactor, and as one among the handful of countries with full nuclear fuel cycle capabilities, India should strive to bring about universal disarmament of nuclear weapons so that world can meet spiralling demand for power through nuclear reactors, which pose no threat to the world peace.","Contributions to Conflict Management, Peace Economics and Development",2013,Volume 21,Issue ccmped/2013/s1572-8323(2013)21/s1572-8323(2013)21/20140912-01,15-24,"Mohan, S.

U.S. and Russian negotiators will have to overcome both political and military obstacles to accomplish post-New START reductions in long-range nuclear weapons. For example, efforts to reduce offensive nuclear weapons are complicated by U.S. and NATO plans for missile defenses deployed in Europe and by exigencies in U.S. and Russian domestic politics. In addition, the military-technical aspects of cyber war and nuclear deterrence can no longer be treated, analytically or practically, as isolated compartments.

The first was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a constellation of space- and ground-based systems that President Ronald Reagan envisioned would render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete.” The second is President Barack Obama's roadmap to “a world without nuclear weapons,” commonly referred to as “Global Zero.” While these proposals appear to have little in common, deeper investigation reveals a number of provocative similarities in motivation and presentation. Moreover, both generated fierce debate, often with ideological overtones, about their strategic desirability and technical feasibility.

This article examines the relationship between a reduced US nuclear arsenal and strategic stability in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. It argues that a series of interrelated political and military factors play a much more significant role in regional security and stability than the US strategic arsenal, which has never, with a few extraordinary exceptions, played a direct role in maintaining regional security. The United States has constructed a system of regional stability based on conventional deterrence and defense that has seen it forward base forces at various installations in the region in combination with efforts to arm, train, and equip host-nation militaries. Nuclear weapons have never played a prominent role in this regional system. Evidence presented in this article suggests that there is no compelling reason for the United States to abandon and/or modify the defensive system of conventional deterrence and defense by adding nuclear-backed guarantees to the mix.",The Nonproliferation Review,2013,20,2,263-278,"Russell, James A.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001423574,1,

Extended nuclear assurance, all too frequently confused with extended nuclear deterrence, faces a daunting series of challenges: a US strategic mainstream fractured on the roles and purposes of nuclear weapons; an Asia where assurance demands are high during a period of strategic uncertainty; and a US theatre- and tactical-range nuclear arsenal much depleted from its heyday. Meanwhile, nuclear latency is growing in Asia as more countries reach the technological level that the US attained in 1945, as nuclear skill sets become more prevalent, and as delivery vehicles appropriate to nuclear weapons become more typical in regional arsenals. The US now provides extended nuclear assurance to nearly 40 countries worldwide, agreeing to run nuclear risks on behalf of its allies and friends. The bulk of those assurances derive from the NATO alliance, but it is the non-NATO-related assurances—and settings—that seem likely to be the more controversial ones over the next decade or two.

pub.1034347311,10.1177/0735275113489561,The Honored Outsider,"Raymond Aron (1905–1983) assumed many guises over a long and fruitful career: journalist, polemicist, philosopher of history, counselor to political leaders and officials, theorist of nuclear deterrence and international relations. He was also France’s most notable sociologist. While Aron had especially close ties with Britain, a result of his days in active exile there during the Second World War, he was widely appreciated in the United States too. His book Main Currents in Sociological Thought was hailed a masterpiece; more generally, Aron’s books were extensively reviewed in the American Journal of Sociology, the American Sociological Review (in earlier days, it hosted a review section), Contemporary Sociology, and Social Forces. And he was admired and cited by sociologists of the stature of Daniel Bell, Edward Shils, and David Riesman. Yet despite appearing well poised to become a major force in international sociology, analogous to his younger collaborator, Pierre Bourdieu, Aron has almost vanished from the sociological landscape. This article explains why, offering in the process some observations on the conditions—conceptual and motivational—of reputational longevity in sociological theory and showing how Aron failed to meet them. Special attention is devoted to a confusing equivocation in Aron’s description of sociology and to the cultural basis of his ambivalence toward the discipline.",Sociological Theory,2013,31,2,93-115,"Baehr, Peter",Lingnan University,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034347311,6,"[Lipset, Seymour Martin]|[ur.010023075360.72]|Sociological Forum|1994|9|2|199-220|10.1007/bf01476362|pub.1009148457|48;[Hall, John A.]|[]|Journal of Classical Sociology|2011|11|2|191-201|10.1177/1468795x10396484|pub.1015349200|3;[Hall, J.

pub.1053929241,10.1177/0022002712448909,What Does It Take to Deter? Regional Power Nuclear Postures and International Conflict,"Existing nuclear deterrence scholarship evinces a pervasive “existential bias,” assuming that once a state merely possesses nuclear weapons, it should be able to deter armed conflict. The empirical literature expresses this bias by simply dichotomously coding a state based on whether it has nuclear weapons, thereby treating all nuclear states as equivalent. Thus, whether nuclear weapons deter conflict, and how much is required to do so, is unclear. This article shifts the unit of analysis away from nuclear weapons to postures, hypothesizing that different nuclear postures are distinct and generate differential deterrent power, particularly amongst the non-superpower states which comprise the lion’s share of nuclear powers. I find that an asymmetric escalation nuclear posture uniquely deters conflict initiation and escalation.

Section 491 states: By not later than 60 days before the date on which the President implements a nuclear employment strategy of the United States that differs from the nuclear employment strategy of the United States then in force, the President shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the following: (1) A description of the modifications to the nuclear employment strategy, plans, and options of the United States made by the strategy so issued. (2) An assessment of effects of such modification for the nuclear posture of the United States. (3) The implication of such changes on the flexibility and resilience of the strategic forces of the United States and the ability of such forces to support the goals of the United States with respect to nuclear deterrence, extended deterrence, assurance, and defense. ( 4) The extent to which such modifications include an increased reliance on conventional or non-nuclear strike capabilities or missile defenses of the United States. With the President's issuance of new nuclear weapons employment guidance, this report is being provided in advance of implementation and, thus, fulfills the requirements of Section 491.

pub.1024056257,10.4324/9780203759271,The United Kingdom and Nuclear Deterrence,"In December 2003 the British government announced that within a few years it would need to take decisions about the future of Britain's strategic nuclear deterrent. Exactly three years later, its plans were revealed in a White Paper. The existing Trident system is to be given a life-extension, which includes building new submarines to carry the missiles, costing £15–20 billion. Britain has a substantial nuclear legacy, having owned nuclear weapons for over half a century. The strategic context for the deterrent has changed completely with the end of the Cold War, but nuclear weapons retain much of their salience. This Adelphi Paper argues that it makes sense to remain a nuclear power in an uncertain and nuclear-armed world. Given that deterrence needs are now less acute, but more complex than in the past, the paper asserts that deterrence also needs to be aligned with non-proliferation policies, which seek to reduce the scale of threats that need to be deterred. Somewhat overlooked in current policy are appropriate measures of defence, which can raise the nuclear threshold and, if required, mitigate the effects of deterrence failure. It concludes that the government's decisions about the future form of the deterrent are very sensible, but cautions that they still need to be integrated into a broader policy that embraces diplomacy, deterrence and defence to counter the risks posed by nuclear proliferation.",,2013,,,,"Stocker, Jeremy",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024056257,1,

Key to this strategy is the bolstering of international/regional support of Taiwan, Taiwanese military deterrence backed by strategically ambiguous U.S. assurances of security, intertwined economic ties between all parties, and a strong informational campaign aimed at lessoning tensions and improving diplomatic relations between all parties involved. The strategy must maintain a delicate balance to ensure neither the PRC nor Taiwan sees a change in U.S. policy towards the sovereignty of Taiwan and therefore an opportunity to attempt unilateral resolution of the One-China issue. Any attempt by either the PRC or Taiwan to resolve the issue would force the U.S. to take one side or the other, either of which would damage U.S. vital national interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Therefore, it remains in the best interest of the U.S. to retain a policy of strategic ambiguity and keep the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.",,2013,,,,"Menist, Robert L",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091782635,0,
pub.1020810906,10.1177/0022343312461023,Is war declining – and why?,"The article reviews and assesses the recent literature that claims a sharp decrease in fighting and violent mortality rate since prehistory and during recent times. It also inquires into the causes of this decrease. The article supports the view, firmly established over the past 15 years and unrecognized by only one of the books reviewed, that the first massive decline in violent mortality occurred with the emergence of the state-Leviathan. Hobbes was right, and Rousseau was wrong, about the great violence of the human state of nature. The rise of the state-Leviathan greatly reduced in-group violent mortality by establishing internal peace. Less recognized, it also decreased out-group war fatalities. Although state wars appear large in absolute terms, large states actually meant lower mobilization rates and reduced exposure of the civilian population to war. A second major step in the decline in the frequency and fatality of war has occurred over the last two centuries, including in recent decades. However, the exact periodization of, and the reasons for, the decline are a matter of dispute among the authors reviewed. Further, the two World Wars constitute a sharp divergence from the trend, which must be accounted for. The article surveys possible factors behind the decrease, such as industrialization and rocketing economic growth, commercial interdependence, the liberal-democratic peace, social attitude change, nuclear deterrence, and UN peacekeeping forces. It argues that contrary to the claim of some of the authors reviewed, war has not become more lethal and destructive over the past two centuries, and thus this factor cannot be the cause of war's decline. Rather, it is peace that has become more profitable. At the same time, the specter of war continues to haunt the parts of the world less affected by many of the above developments, and the threat of unconventional terror is real and troubling.",Journal of Peace Research,2013,50,2,149-157,"Gat, Azar",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020810906,17,"[Zerjal, Tatiana; Xue, Yali; Bertorelle, Giorgio; Wells, R Spencer; Bao, Weidong; Zhu, Suling; Qamar, Raheel; Ayub, Qasim; Mohyuddin, Aisha; Fu, Songbin; Li, Pu; Yuldasheva, Nadira; Ruzibakiev, Ruslan; Xu, Jiujin; Shu, Qunfang; Du, Ruofu; Yang, Huanming; Hurles, Matthew E; Robinson, Elizabeth; Gerelsaikhan, Tudevdagva; Dashnyam, Bumbein; Mehdi, S Qasim; Tyler-Smith, Chris]|[ur.0733471747.08; ur.0707766726.43; ur.01260770410.11; ur.01053573721.02; ur.0754504132.74; ur.01022617332.45; ur.01256606310.46; ur.01104725045.85; ur.01153040245.02; ur.07553560452.89; ur.01075753106.12; ur.01144063363.41; ur.0764167401.10; ur.01032405775.50; ur.0712535272.05; ur.0711110015.18; ur.01231641167.20; ur.015724616117.08; ur.01143212272.16; ur.01355370202.21; ur.0607504752.99; ur.011535562717.13; ur.0733101002.90]|American Journal of Human Genetics|2003|72|3|717-21|10.1086/367774|pub.1040921277|315;[Gurr, Ted Robert]|[ur.015437353073.49]|Crime and Justice|1981|3||295-353|10.1086/449082|pub.1058733738|184;[Levy, Jack S.; Thompson, William R.]|[; ]||2011||||10.7208/chicago/9780226476278.001.0001|pub.1099396065|28;[]|[]||1999||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198204022.001.0001|pub.1108248223|75"

If history is a teacher then the United States military will find ways to gain cyber superiority, although critics would argue that there is no such thing as cyber superiority. Additionally the US military continues to struggle with its thinking and approach as to how to wield cyber power in and through what is now considered a contested domain. Some of the issues facing commanders and cyber operators include obtaining legal authority to pursue an adversary across sovereign borders, division of labor among statutory titles, agencies and departments within the US government, balancing intelligence gain and loss, and the difficulty of attribution. The first step to overcoming the operational challenges is to recognize that planning and executing cyber operations should not be any different than planning and executing operations in the air, land, and maritime domains.While deterrence has always been part of the US military strategy cyber as a flexible deterrent option is not currently in the tool kit for the Joint Forces Commanders to draw from. Although USSTRATCOM may have the expertise and experience regarding deterrence, 24th Air Force should pursue and develop a cyber force competent in the art of cyber deterrence and be the lead to create a cyber operational plan to ensure full spectrum cyber operations in support of the JFCs. More importantly 24 AF should adopt and apply the Single Integrated Operational Plan, the United States' general plan for nuclear war from 1961 to 2003, and the Joint Operation Planning Process as the model to use in planning and employing cyber power in support of JFCs.",,2013,,,,"Hoang, Harold T",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091577290,0,
pub.1091741732,10.21236/ad1018881,Tacit Knowledge Involvement in the Production of Nuclear Weapons: A Critical Component of a Credible US Nuclear Deterrent in the 21st Century,"Preservation of nuclear weapon tacit knowledge has not previously been linked to maintaining a credible US nuclear deterrent. President Obamas 2009 Prague speech committing the US to seek a world without nuclear weapons, has yielded two policy debates: the necessary arsenal size and force configuration required to have a credible deterrent while following the Road to Global Zero nuclear weapons, and the potential feasibility of getting to zero due to shortcomings in monitoring and verification. Absent from these debates, and indeed missing from the discussions altogether, is the role of tacit knowledge about nuclear weapon design and development on the road to zero. The relationship between tacit knowledge and credible nuclear deterrence has yet to be examined. US weapons designed to last 10 years are now over 20 years old and projected to be maintained for several more decades while the last of the scientific community having actual experience designing and testing nuclear weapons are preparing for retirement. If both explicit and tacit knowledge are required in the knowledge transfer process, and all those with process knowledge retire, there will be no one left who has the tacit knowledge required for building a nuclear weapon in a timely fashion. In this paper, tacit knowledge is defined along with the relevance of tacit knowledge in creating a nuclear weapon and the need for nuclear tacit knowledge preservation and transfer in todays environment. An assessment of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggests that neither the working environment nor the data management system in place currently fosters tacit knowledge transfer or capture. Recommendations are offered as steps to enhance tacit knowledge preservation and transfer to support a credible nuclear deterrent through the next several decades until such time as the Road to Global Zero comes to an end or takes a critical detour.",,2013,,,,"Buffett, Stephanie J",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091741732,0,
pub.1091772421,10.21236/ad1018889,The Future of US Nuclear Deterrence and the Impact of the Global Zero Movement,"Advocates have recently proffered the Global Zero Commission (GZC) proposal as an alternative US nuclear strategy. The potential impact of the GZC proposal warrants a thorough examination of its background, theoretical roots, assumptions and impacts to include a comparison to US strategy. This papers analysis finds the overall GZC framework to be insufficient and potentially harmful to US national security.The GZ recommends an aggressive advance toward nuclear weapons elimination and proposes short-term reductions well beyond current US plans. The proposal presumes significant international cooperation. The most appealing GZC recommendation is for a de facto minimum deterrence model en route to GZ. To its detriment, however, the GZC proposal relies on the implausibility of future nuclear conflict with Russia or China and that a reduced US arsenal will remain a capable, credible deterrent. Ironically, the GZC touts superior conventional forces and Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems as a replacement for a US nuclear deterrent even as these capabilities appear to fuel further nuclear arms races. A final GZC proposal shortcoming is the lack of any definitive recommendations specifically addressing continued nuclear proliferation by rogue states.Finally, this paper provides three recommendations: 1) US arsenal size considerations must be driven by a resolute prioritization of national security maintenance and not devolve into a utopian pursuit of numerical reductions 2) BMD deployment must be tempered to prevent global strategic disruptions 3) a coherent strategy to counter nuclear proliferation by rogue nations must be developed, socialized, and pursued.",,2013,,,,"Frank, Seth C",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091772421,0,
pub.1071272313,10.3402/egp.v6i3.20344,Liberal democracy and nuclear despotism: two ethical foreign policy dilemmas,"This article advances a critical analysis of John Rawls's justification of liberal democratic nuclear deterrence in the post-Cold War era as found in The Law of Peoples. Rawls's justification overlooked how nuclear-armed liberal democracies are ensnared in two intransigent ethical dilemmas: one in which the mandate to secure liberal constitutionalism requires both the preservation and violation of important constitutional provisions in domestic affairs, and the other in which this same mandate requires both the preservation and violation of the liberal commitment to international legal arrangements and to the rule of law generally. On this view, the choice to violate constitutional provisions and international legal arrangements is evidence of nuclear despotism. Moreover, this choice does not imply that the ethical foreign policy dilemmas were resolved. Instead, it implies that the dilemmas force liberal democratic governments into implementing ethically paradoxical policy outcomes.",Ethics & Global Politics,2013,6,3,155-174,"Doyle, Thomas E.",Texas State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1071272313,4,
pub.1028583374,10.1017/s0020818312000392,Crisis Bargaining and Nuclear Blackmail,"Abstract Do nuclear weapons offer coercive advantages in international crisis bargaining? Almost seventy years into the nuclear age, we still lack a complete answer to this question. While scholars have devoted significant attention to questions about nuclear deterrence, we know comparatively little about whether nuclear weapons can help compel states to change their behavior. This study argues that, despite their extraordinary power, nuclear weapons are uniquely poor instruments of compellence. Compellent threats are more likely to be effective under two conditions: first, if a challenger can credibly threaten to seize the item in dispute; and second, if enacting the threat would entail few costs to the challenger. Nuclear weapons, however, meet neither of these conditions. They are neither useful tools of conquest nor low-cost tools of punishment. Using a new dataset of more than 200 militarized compellent threats from 1918 to 2001, we find strong support for our theory: compellent threats from nuclear states are no more likely to succeed, even after accounting for possible selection effects in the data. While nuclear weapons may carry coercive weight as instruments of deterrence, it appears that these effects do not extend to compellence.",International Organization,2013,67,1,173-195,"Sechser, Todd S.; Fuhrmann, Matthew",University of Virginia; Texas A&M University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028583374,36,"[Sechser, Todd S.]|[ur.014117123173.26]|Conflict Management and Peace Science|2011|28|4|377-401|10.1177/0738894211413066|pub.1001473149|30;[Narang, Vipin]|[ur.015524123107.00]|International Security|2010|34|3|38-78|10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38|pub.1003337139|34;[Lyall, Jason; Wilson, Isaiah]|[ur.07753756553.03; ]|International Organization|2009|63|1|67-106|10.1017/s0020818309090031|pub.1004207792|179;[Fearon, James D.]|[ur.0773121250.02]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1994|38|2|236-269|10.1177/0022002794038002004|pub.1007514612|190;[Gavin, Francis J.]|[ur.012732073475.73]|International Security|2005|29|3|100-135|10.1162/0162288043467504|pub.1010591169|33;[Fuhrmann, Matthew; Kreps, Sarah E.]|[ur.07414113515.41; ur.015146306243.38]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2010|54|6|831-859|10.1177/0022002710371671|pub.1015707075|33;[Pape, Robert A.]|[]|International Security|1997|22|2|90-136|10.1162/isec.22.2.90|pub.1017970994|288;[Gelpi, Christopher F.; Griesdorf, Michael]|[ur.011565605737.37; ur.0605565462.32]|American Political Science Review|2001|95|3|633-647|10.1017/s0003055401003148|pub.1023690389|107;[Fearon, James]|[]|International Interactions|2002|28|1|5-29|10.1080/03050620210390|pub.1027607822|56;[Downes, Alexander B.; Sechser, Todd S.]|[ur.013765635717.58; ur.014117123173.26]|International Organization|2012|66|3|457-489|10.1017/s0020818312000161|pub.1030551602|61;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction|2004|||73-95|10.1017/cbo9780511606861.005|pub.1044180087|9;[Sechser, Todd S.]|[ur.014117123173.26]|International Organization|2010|64|4|627-660|10.1017/s0020818310000214|pub.1051759854|51;[Narang, Vipin]|[ur.015524123107.00]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2013|57|3|478-508|10.1177/0022002712448909|pub.1053929241|19;[Singh, Sonali; Way, Christopher R.]|[; ur.011447561417.21]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2004|48|6|859-885|10.1177/0022002704269655|pub.1063625368|107;[Beardsley, Kyle; Asal, Victor]|[ur.012752247533.46; ur.012170215167.39]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2009|53|2|278-301|10.1177/0022002708330386|pub.1063625453|33;[Heckman, James J.]|[]|Econometrica|1979|47|1|153|10.2307/1912352|pub.1069640134|12891;[Foot, Rosemary J.]|[]|International Security|1988|13|3|92|10.2307/2538737|pub.1069980413|32;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|International Security|1994|18|4|66|10.2307/2539178|pub.1069980745|79;[Petersen, Walter J.]|[]|International Studies Quarterly|1986|30|3|269|10.2307/2600418|pub.1070020418|18;[Art, Robert J.]|[]|International Security|1980|4|4|3|10.2307/2626666|pub.1070041538|56;[Norris, Robert S.; Kristensen, Hans M.]|[; ]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2006|62|4|64-66|10.2968/062004017|pub.1070929596|23;[Tannenwald, Nina]|[]||2007||||10.1017/cbo9780511491726|pub.1098665913|146;[Brecher, Michael; Wilkenfeld, Jonathan]|[; ]||1997||||10.3998/mpub.14982|pub.1099303330|175;[Kissinger, Henry A.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1956|34|3|349|10.2307/20031169|pub.1102750425|13;[McNamara, Robert S.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1983|62|1|59|10.2307/20041735|pub.1102754427|50;[King, Gary; Keohane, Robert O.; Verba, Sidney]|[ur.01073223224.00; ur.014127647347.69; ur.01306037451.09]||1994||||10.1515/9781400821211|pub.1113146728|2342"
pub.1071196682,10.3366/jbctv.2013.0119,"Images of Survival, Stories of Destruction: Nuclear War on British Screens from 1945 to the Early 1960s","This article discusses a range of depictions and discussions of nuclear war, which appeared on British screens in the first half of the Cold War, in order to understand the changing way nuclear weapons were viewed within British culture. Using such screened images to understand how nuclear war was constructed and represented within British culture, the article argues that the hydrogen bomb, not the atomic bomb, was the true harbinger of the nuclear revolution that transformed cultural understandings of warfare and destruction. Although the atomic bomb created a great deal of anxiety within British popular culture, representations of atomic attack elided atomic destruction with that experienced in 1939–45, emphasising the ‘survivability’ of atomic war. In the thermonuclear era, the Second World War could not undertake the same symbolic work. The image of the city-destroying bomb was an imaginative as well as technological step-change. Screened representations stressed that a thermonuclear war would literally end the world. As such, they preceded, and indeed provided the cultural climate for, the rise of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). The Campaign exploited and further popularised this idea of the apocalyptic nuclear war as a key aspect of its political and moral standpoint. The article concludes, however, that the cultural hegemony of this vision of nuclear war equally helped underpin notions of nuclear deterrence. The basic assumptions about the nature of nuclear war constructed and circulated on British screens therefore formed part of CND's ‘cultural’ victory but the article also explains why this did not translate into the political realm.",Journal of British Cinema and Television,2013,10,1,7-26,"Grant, Matthew",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1071196682,3,"[Nehring, Holger]|[]|Contemporary British History|2005|19|2|223-241|10.1080/13619460500080314|pub.1003208970|10;[Grant, Matthew]|[ur.013776020753.13]||2010||||10.1057/9780230274044|pub.1026074041|29;[Shaw, Tony]|[]|Contemporary British History|2005|19|2|109-115|10.1080/13619460500080140|pub.1048441285|8;[Summerfield, Penny]|[]|Journal of British Studies|2009|48|4|935-957|10.1086/603598|pub.1058809074|4;[Shaw, T.]|[]|The English Historical Review|2006|CXXI|494|1351-1384|10.1093/ehr/cel282|pub.1059544479|13;[Chapman, James]|[]|Journal of Contemporary History|2006|41|1|75-94|10.1177/0022009406058675|pub.1063626738|12;[Eley, Geoff]|[]|The American Historical Review|2001|106|3|818|10.2307/2692326|pub.1070063065|23;[Eley, Geoff]|[]|The American Historical Review|2001|106|3|818-838|10.1086/ahr/106.3.818|pub.1084550937|3;[Ramsden, John]|[]|Journal of Contemporary History|1998|33|1|35-63|10.1177/003200949803300103|pub.1090630097|16"

But — whether the context is major powers seeking to neutralise threats from each other (United States, Russia, China and India), non-nuclear allies seeking nuclear protection from various threat contingencies (Japan, South Korea and Australia) or vulnerable states seeking a ‘strategic equaliser’ (Pakistan and North Korea) — the traditional strategic arguments for nuclear deterrence are much weaker than they may first seem. Whatever may have been the case for the Cold War years, in today’s world the risks associated with the acquisition or retention of nuclear weapons far outweigh any conceivable utility they may have. The financial arguments against them — that they are indefensibly costly — are strong. And the humanitarian arguments are overwhelming: nuclear weapons remain the most indiscriminately inhumane ever devised, and they should be outlawed as chemical and biological weapons have been. Making disarmament happen will never be easy, but — with the right political leadership — is not impossible. Focusing, realistically, in the first instance on minimization rather than elimination, practical steps can be taken to dramatically reduce nuclear weapon numbers, deployment and alert status, and doctrinal reliance on them.

Deterrence in cyberspace as a national strategy, for example, was not a focal point in these forums. Since 2010, however, states have recognized the political ramifications of these decisions and have begun to exercise their authority by actively engaging with the technical community through bilateral, regional, and multilateral initiatives. In 2010, the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (GGE) made recommendations for further dialogue among states and other actors regarding norms pertaining to state use of ICTs to reduce collective risk and protect critical national and international infrastructure.

Section 2.4 is based on material contained in National Research Council, in Proceedings of a workshop on deterring cyberattacks: informing strategies and developing options for U.S. policy, 2010). Section 2.1 describes a broad context for cybersecurity, establishing its importance and characterizing the threat. Section 2.2 sketches a range of possible approaches for how the nation might respond to cybersecurity threats, emphasizing how little is known about how such approaches might be effective in an operational role. Section 2.3 describes a research agenda intended to develop more knowledge and insight into these various approaches.

pub.1027407570,10.3327/taesj.j12.027,The Making of French Nuclear Energy PolicyThrough the Relationship between Civilian and Military Use,"The French history of nuclear development clearly shows the inseparability of its civilian use from military use. In France, Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique (CEA) and Électricité de France (EDF) have played an important role in research and development of nuclear technology since the postwar period. At first, the two organizations had kept great autonomy, but the government reinforced its control on them because France needed nuclear deterrence against the Soviet Union. France began using plutonium in 1952, and the Suez crisis in 1956 showed the need for nuclear force to ensure its independence. After this event, France managed the first nuclear test using plutonium in 1960. As for enriched uranium, they have long had great difficulty in securing it. The uranium enrichment technology became crucial also in civilian use in this period. EDF proposed the pressurized water reactor (PWR), which requires enriched uranium, as the future reactor type because of its economic advantage, but CEA wanted to continue developing the gas-cooled reactor (GCR) because of its independence in nuclear fuel supply. Finally, they chose PWR because a French enrichment facility was built in 1967. From such French history, we can say that the civilian and military use of nuclear technology are inseparable.",Transactions of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan,2013,12,2,138,"KIMURA, Kenji",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027407570,0,
pub.1037129768,10.1057/9781137334244_6,The Moral Aspects of Deterrence,"The failure to secure a British H-bomb test ban brought the BCC specific problems. First, its officers were aware that many Christians felt that nuclear, and in particular thermonuclear weapons, were uniquely abhorrent. This sense was only exacerbated once western nuclear strategy was considered. Second, they nonetheless felt unable to disavow nuclear weapons and resort to renunciation or ‘third way’ nuclear pacifism. At this juncture Rear Admiral Sir Anthony Buzzard offered his expertise to the BCC. For the first time discussion moved from generalised endstype analysis to concerted deliberation over specific nuclear means. To understand the impact of Admiral Buzzard’s thinking on the churches, it is necessary to locate his thinking in the wider strategic environment. In 1952 Britain became the first western government to base its national security planning almost entirely on a declaratory policy of nuclear deterrence. Out of the Korean War rearmament experience, the conclusion was drawn that the continuation of large, balanced and well-equipped conventional forces was not compatible with the requirements of a healthy economy (Pierre, 1972). In spring 1952 Prime Minister Churchill directed his Chiefs of Staff to undertake a fundamental defence review taking into account the state of the economy, the role of nuclear weapons, and the need for reduced conventional ground forces.","Cold War Christians and the Spectre of Nuclear Deterrence, 1945–1959",2013,,,105-124,"Gorry, Jonathan",Nottingham Trent University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037129768,0,
pub.1102376249,10.2139/ssrn.2251486,A Double Edged Sword: Nuclear Risk and Nuclear Deterrence,"The majority of empirical studies of the various effects of nuclear weapons treat these weapons as a binary variable: what matter is only whether or not a particular state at any given time possesses these weapons or not. There are, however, strong reasons to think that the effect of a state's nuclear arsenal is conditioned by how that state makes a score of consequential decisions regarding how these weapons should be managed, under what circumstances they may be deployed or even used, and so on. I argue that the effect is fundamentally conditioned by something I call nuclear risk: the overall likelihood that these weapons may be used without authorization by the political leaders. I show that higher risk is associated with greater deterrent power. But this deterrence is obtained at a considerable cost: state that have nuclear weapons with higher risks are less assertive in reciprocating militarized disputes when their deterrence fails. I test these two hypotheses using correlates of war data. Not satisfied with a simple index of risk I propose a novel technique that allows us to jointly test the two hypotheses without the need to explicitly provide measures for risk. Both theoretical expectations about the benefit and the cost of risk are corroborated by empirical evidence.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2013,,,,"Sanaei, Ali",Shahid Beheshti University,Iran,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102376249,0,"[Narang, Vipin]|[ur.015524123107.00]|International Security|2010|34|3|38-78|10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38|pub.1003337139|34;[Gartzke, Erik; Kroenig, Matthew]|[ur.014753037012.98; ur.07615147657.32]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2009|53|2|151-160|10.1177/0022002708330039|pub.1024428584|29;[Gartzke, Erik]|[ur.014753037012.98]|American Journal of Political Science|2007|51|1|166-191|10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00244.x|pub.1030087062|295;[Lemke, Douglas; Reed, William]|[; ]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2001|45|1|126-144|10.1177/0022002701045001006|pub.1050379927|105;[King, Gary; Zeng, Langche]|[ur.01073223224.00; ur.016576067001.00]|Political Analysis|2001|9|2|137-163|10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a004868|pub.1059963156|1706;[Gartzke, Erik; Jo, Dong-Joon]|[ur.014753037012.98; ur.015037124164.39]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2009|53|2|209-233|10.1177/0022002708330289|pub.1063625452|40;[Beardsley, Kyle; Asal, Victor]|[ur.012752247533.46; ur.012170215167.39]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2009|53|2|278-301|10.1177/0022002708330386|pub.1063625453|33;[Rauchhaus, Robert]|[]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2009|53|2|258-277|10.1177/0022002708330387|pub.1063625454|62;[Mueller, John]|[]|International Security|1988|13|2|55|10.2307/2538971|pub.1069980600|85;[Beck, Nathaniel; Katz, Jonathan N.; Tucker, Richard]|[; ; ]|American Journal of Political Science|1998|42|4|1260|10.2307/2991857|pub.1070161653|1288;[Treverton, Gregory F.; Jervis, Robert]|[; ]|Foreign Affairs|1989|68|5|207|10.2307/20044214|pub.1102756918|26"
pub.1034703873,10.1057/9781137334244_8,Redacting Just War,"1957 was a significant year for the British nuclear deterrence debate. Christopher Driver (1964) recalls four events that precipitated the emergence of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). First, the Labour Party Conference where Nye Bevan denounced unilateral nuclear reunciation as tantamount to ‘sending a Foreign Secretary naked into the conference chamber’. Second, J. B. Priestley’s New Statesman riposte to Bevan which argued that Britain’s nuclear policy negated democratic politics by placing crucial decisions beyond ordinary citizens. Third, George Kennan’s Reith Lectures because for most people outside the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) they were the first indication that there was a considered alternative to massive retaliation. Finally, the launching of Sputnik I that demonstrated, because the Soviets had the system technology to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles, the West had lost its technological lead over the Soviet Union on which its concept of deterrence rested. To these events of note may be added the Yale statements by the CCIA and the WCC. This latter was the most important for the churches because it amounted to official ecumenical endorsement for ‘third way’ (i.e. nuclear pacifist) engagement. Against this background the British Council of Churches had formed a study group to consider the moral aspects of defence.","Cold War Christians and the Spectre of Nuclear Deterrence, 1945–1959",2013,,,145-170,"Gorry, Jonathan",Nottingham Trent University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034703873,0,

This conceptual-design paper, uniquely, builds upon a number of entangled, cross disciplinary research strands – integrating engineering and conflict studies – and a detailed literature review to propose a new paradigm of assurance and deterrence models. We consider an ontology for Cyber-sÛréte which combines both the social trusts necessary for [knowledge & information] assurance such as collaboration by social influence (CSI) and the technological controls and rules for secure information management referred as coordination by rule and control (CRC). We posit Cyber-sÛréte as enabling both a ‘safe-to-fail’ ecology (in which learning, testing and adaptation can take place) within a fail-safe supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA type) system, e.g. in a nuclear power plant. Building upon traditional state-based threat analysis, we consider Warning Time and the Threat equation with relation to policies for managing Cyber-Deterrence. We examine how the goods of Cyber – might be galvanised so as to encourage virtuous behaviour and deter and/or dissuade ne'er-do-wells through multiple transparencies. We consider how the Deterrence-escalator may be managed by identifying both weak influence and strong control signals so as to create a more benign and responsive cyberecology, in which strengths can be exploited and weaknesses identified.

Turkish security will ultimately be damaged by Iranian attempts to acquire a nuclear bomb. The credibility of extended deterrence will surely be the key factor in averting regional decisions to opt for nuclear status in the face of a likely threshold nuclear Tehran. Current proposals regarding missile defence and precision guided weapons as optimum tools of deterrence fall short as alternatives compared with a credible reliable nuclear deterrence. So as long as NATO maintains a credible mix of nuclear and conventional means of deterrence, and guarantees allied security via strengthened extended assurance, Turkey will be comfortable when confronted with new nuclear states in its region. Ankara's likely response is expected to favour strengthening security relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and seeking to bolster the American/NATO security guarantee, rather than decoupling from the alliance. As long as American/NATO extended deterrence is adapted to the new conditions and continuity is assured, a Turkish decision to decouple from the Western alliance or opt for its own individual nuclear capability remains only a distant possibility.",Contemporary Security Policy,2012,33,3,512-529,"Güney, Nurşin Ateşoğlu",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003846445,0,

Lessons learned by American practitioners and academics contributed to the conduct of American foreign policy in the 1960s and to academic understanding of nuclear deterrence, nuclear crises and crisis management in general. Nearly 50 fifty years of scholarship have generated new insights and understanding. From the 1980s, study of what in Moscow was termed the Caribbean crisis was informed by access to Soviet officials and Soviet archives, and became the forefront of the ‘new historiography’ of the Cold War. This collection reviews how various texts inform our understanding and how new interpretations and/or new sources of information have overtaken (or indeed validated) the original analysis. This article provides an overview of this endeavour and an answer to the question of whether we should continue to study the Cuban missile crisis.",International Relations,2012,26,3,255-266,"Scott, Len",Aberystwyth University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011636344,1,

As an ‘interim ethic’ the dominant Catholic position accepted the legitimacy of nuclear deterrence, but rejected many of the doctrines that underpinned nuclear strategy at the time. Since the end of the Cold War this position has come under increased scrutiny from within the Church. Some commentators claim that the time has come for the Church to officially jettison any vestiges of the interim ethic and reject nuclear strategy outright on moral grounds. Others argue that the Church's position is unsustainable from a strategic perspective. This paper presents a reappraisal of the Catholic position on nuclear strategy. In particular, the work assesses whether there is any common ground between the Strategic Studies approach to nuclear strategy and the Catholic position. The paper concludes that, with evolution in both perspectives, limited congruence can be expanded to produce a new nuclear strategy that satisfies both strategy and Catholic teaching.",Journal of Military Ethics,2012,11,3,186-207,"Lonsdale, David J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051792981,1,"[Gray, Colin S.; Payne, Keith]|[; ]|Foreign Policy|1980||39|14|10.2307/1148409|pub.1102456793|58;[Wohlstetter, Albert]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1959|37|2|211|10.2307/20029345|pub.1102763664|138"

Apartheid South Africa's Nuclear Weapons Strategy,"Although South Africa's nuclear decommissioning has received extensive analysis in the proliferation literature, few have devoted much attention to understanding how the apartheid government's purported weapons strategy modifies existing theories of nuclear deterrence. Importantly, a principal objective of South Africa's arsenal was not to deter hostile neighbouring countries by threatening tactical use of nuclear force as in classical deterrence theory, but instead to compel the intervention of an ambivalent ally, the United States. Thus, the case does not correspond to existing deterrence theories, which envision situations involving only a ‘defender’ and ‘initiator’, and more accurately may be conceptualized as ‘catalytic deterrence’. While South Africa is a unique case of denuclearization, the country's nuclear strategy shares many characteristics with other ‘opaque’ proliferators, such as no nuclear tests, denial of possession, and no direct threats. Understanding the mechanism of South Africa's catalytic deterrent subsequently provides an important case to amend our notions of deterrence and how similar opaque arsenals – such as those of Israel – may be employed in the future.",Politikon,2012,39,2,209-230,"Goodson, Donald L.

pub.1053863941,10.1177/0920203x12439973,Change and innovation in Chinese nuclear weapons strategy,"This article explores change and conceptual innovation in Chinese nuclear weapons strategy. It argues that drastic change towards a war-fighting strategy is not considered likely. Some transition is underway, towards what some have termed assured retaliation, but this transition is not a dramatic departure from past strategy which was based on uncertain retaliation. To illustrate this view, the article focuses on three areas: declaratory nuclear policy, military modernization, and academic discussions among military and civilian strategists in China. Declaratory policy offers a useful lens through which to consider Chinese nuclear strategy, especially nuclear deterrence and the policy of no first use. For its part, China’s ongoing military modernization has been a source of much concern in the West, but here a distinction is made between nuclear and non-nuclear modernization, and emphasis is placed on how both underpin no first use.

pub.1039267117,10.1108/14636681211239782,Moral nuclear deterrence – the ascendancy of missile defense,"Purpose – The strategic standoff, known as mutual assured destruction (MAD) by the USA and nuclear parity by Russia, has been overtaken by the advance of technology and the demise of the Soviet Union. Pacing technology is being exploited by an increasingly mature missile defense. If implemented comprehensively, it could have widespread and revolutionary ramifications. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The article describes the historical background of America's nuclear strategy, from Eisenhower to the Obama Administration. It then traces the history of missile defense and arms limitation and develops the context of the interaction between them. It is found that nuclear arsenals should not be reduced to zero because that would put rogue nations in a position where they could intimidate the world. Finally, the evolution of computer chip technology, as embodied by Moore's law, is traced. The recommendation is made to proceed with the reduction of nuclear stockpiles to the level of a few hundred each, and to proceed with the implementation of comprehensive missile defenses. Findings – The most important is the practicality of reducing nuclear arsenals to a few hundred on either side. That strategy is called “moral deterrence” herein. It is moral because, as opposed to MAD, it does not hold extensive civilian populations of the world hostage. At the same time, it is a sufficiently strong deterrent to prevent rogue nations from acquiring and threatening with illicit nuclear weapons. Moral deterrence is a better strategic option than the “nuclear‐free world” advocated by the Obama administration since nuclear‐free does not preclude intimidation by rogues. Research limitations/implications – Technology enabling reliable missile defense is based on high‐speed, large‐capacity, miniaturized computer chips. It permits fast and reliable computations that can process real‐time data from radar, infrared, and optical sensors so that a hit‐to‐kill capability can be realized. It also permits the implementation of deformable mirrors for the adaptive optics used in high‐energy lasers. Much of the technology for modern missile defense flowed from the Strategic Defense Initiative; it was not predicted by the critics of three decades ago. Originality/value – The principal aspects of originality involve the analytical tradeoffs between the nuclear stockpiles of the principal powers and the viability of missile defense. The analysis indicates that if the stockpiles are reduced to a few hundred each, then even imperfect missile defense is very effective in providing protection, providing it is triply redundant. Stockpiles reduced to ten or less leave the principal powers vulnerable to intimidation by rogue nations, and should be avoided. The article also finds that missile defense has been enabled technologically by Moore's law, and that it can be expected to improve further by the year 2020.",Foresight,2012,Volume 14,Issue 3,260-271,"Schaffer, Marvin",RAND Corporation,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039267117,0,"[Mollick, E.]|[ur.014400567742.05]|Annals of the History of Computing|2006|28|3|62-75|10.1109/mahc.2006.45|pub.1061382515|113;[]|[]|Choice|2010|47|07|47-3976-47-3976|10.5860/choice.47-3976|pub.1073437285|4"

The Australian case study demonstrates how periods of nuclear order and disorder can inform a state's attitudes toward the credibility of extended nuclear deterrence. Australia's interest in a nuclear weapons capability from 1956 to 1972 was symptomatic of a period of nuclear disorder. This interest declined from the early 1970s due to changes in both the global and regional environments where the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons was relatively contained. This emerging, recognizable nuclear order diminished the interest in an indigenous nuclear weapons capability and led Canberra to rely on US extended nuclear deterrence. This order has remained fairly robust for more than 30 years. However, beyond 2012, we may yet witness a breakdown in this order. This will generate a much greater interest by US allies in the operational aspects of US extended nuclear deterrence.",Asian Security,2012,8,2,93-114,"Leah, Christine M.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044772361,4,

It argues that the pattern of presidential discourse reveals that both presidents have regarded Russia's nuclear weapons as primarily political rather than military instruments. Both Putin and Medvedev demonstrated a sustained desire to pursue strategic nuclear arms reductions through negotiations, particularly on a bilateral basis with the United States, and an interest in minimum nuclear deterrence. The shifts in position taken by both presidents on US plans for missile defence in particular reveal that they each attached as much, if not more, importance to Russia being regarded as an equal partner by the United States than to any strategic gains that might be achieved through preventing the deployment of an effective missile defence system.",Europe Asia Studies,2012,64,3,495-519,"Mathers, Jennifer G.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016585765,2,"[SAKWA, RICHARD]|[]|International Affairs|2008|84|2|241-267|10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00702.x|pub.1010448670|54;[Mankoff, Jeffrey]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|2007|30|2|123-135|10.1162/wash.2007.30.2.123|pub.1013443151|11;[Stent, Angela E.]|[]|Europe Asia Studies|2008|60|6|1089-1106|10.1080/09668130802161264|pub.1029868263|27;[Mansourov, Alexandre Y.]|[ur.011307352411.06]|Korean Journal of Defense Analysis|2005|17|1|151-184|10.1080/10163270509464078|pub.1051599751|6;[]|[]|International Affairs|1963|39|4|617-617|10.1093/ia/39.4.617e|pub.1083571919|1;[Trenin, Dmitri]|[]|Foreign Affairs|2006|85|4|87|10.2307/20032043|pub.1102750746|50;[Lo, Bobo]|[]||2003||||10.1002/9780470696408|pub.1109698981|33"

Documents like the new FCO collection help to remind us that the past was truly in some ways ‘another country’. In the early post-war years, for example, before collective nuclear deterrence, there was huge uncertainty both over the scale of Communist advances and the viability of Western defence. The Nordic defence pact alternative thus deserved serious thought, but the reasons for its ultimate sidelining carry lessons still relevant today about the limits and functionality of Nordic cooperation. Interestingly, Britain seemed (and seems?) driven to repeatedly seek more from the latter than it can deliver. While close, British–Nordic relations were and remain prone to misapprehension and ruffled sensitivities caused inter alia by different ‘mental maps’ and group-building instincts.

So we have been spared the horror of a large nuclear war during this period when more than 130,000 nuclear weapons were built. This is a very unusual event in the history of mankind: so many weapons built, never to be used. Why has this happened? First, the leadership of the two nuclear superpowers and of the smaller nuclear States behaved as rational decision makers, as far as the control of nuclear weapons and the decision not to initiate their use were concerned. In others words, deterrence worked, but we have to recall that the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 and other lesser crises pushed the risk of a nuclear confrontation very close to the abyss. Moreover, the system of nuclear deterrence worked and still works now on the basis of the capability of each nuclear superpower to react promptly if they receive information that they are under nuclear missile attack from their opponent. The idea is that each nuclear superpower should react against the opponent before its own nuclear missiles are destroyed while still on the ground or in their silos. With this system, known as nuclear reaction alert or “launch on warning”, we have had numerous incidents of false attack that risked accidental nuclear war. Among the factors that spared mankind from the horror of a nuclear war, one was good luck, in not taking wrong decisions at critical moments, and in keeping technical mistakes and failures ultimately under control.",UN Chronicle,2012,46,2,41-49,"Cotta-Ramusino, Paolo",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120303941,0,

Deterrence and Norms in Cyberspace,"This article relates American efforts to develop strategic ‘cyber deterrence’ as a means to deter adversarial actions in and through global cyberspace. Thus far, interests- based cyber deterrence theory has failed to translate into effective American policy and strategy, due to a divergence between the operational idiosyncrasies of cyberspace and an over-reliance on Cold War models of deterrence. Even while explicit cyber deterrence strategy falters, the United States is pursuing a normsbased approach to cyber strategy generally, and hopes to derive deterrent effects from its attempts to broker international agreements pertaining to the ‘rules of the road’ for the proper and productive use of cyberspace. The United States is not the only norm entrepreneur in this policy space, however, and this article examines how a range of other state and non-state actors are complicating efforts to develop normative regimes that might reduce risks to and from cyberspace. The article concludes that a norms-based approach to cyber deterrence might engender deterrent effects at the state level but is unlikely to do so in the case of ‘rogue’ states and many non-state actors. States will continue, therefore, to develop punitive deterrence capabilities to respond to these actors.",Contemporary Security Policy,2012,33,1,148-170,"Stevens, Tim",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010718194,24,

Specific attention was also given to the utility of conventional force as a deterrent, to the prospects for cyber deterrence, and to the feasibility of deterring non-state actors such as terrorist organizations.

Deterrence is now less salient in national security policies and international security management, more recessed, particularly nuclear deterrence. This is primarily due to the huge changes in international politics ushered in by the end of the Cold War, particularly in great-power political relationships, and which are continuing to unfold. Important developments are underway with respect to nuclear deterrence, extended deterrence, collective actor deterrence, and other aspects of international system security. While many old topics pertaining to deterrence continue to be studied and generate continuing controversies, often along the same lines as in the past, some important investigations and theoretical analyses have also emerged on pivotal deterrence, the deterrence of cyberattacks, terrorism, and international crime. What is needed most is analysis on how to develop and apply deterrence strategy and practice in new ways as a central contribution to global and regional system security maintenance and management, a function deterrence performed during the Cold War but in ways now largely out of date. Also needed is careful attention to the possibility of the return of more traditional international politics, particularly if this were to occur in relations among the major states, and careful consideration of how best to use deterrence to hedge against such a development.",Contemporary Security Policy,2012,33,1,85-107,"Morgan, Patrick M.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015704833,28,

In this article, credibility is used as a lens through which to examine the effectiveness of conventional force as a deterrent. An advantage that conventional force enjoys over its nuclear counterpart is that it can be used with much greater discrimination. Conventional threats can, therefore, be considered more politically credible than nuclear threats under all but the most extreme circumstances. Conversely, the relatively modest power of conventional weapons renders their effects ‘interpretable’ to a problematic degree by potential aggressors. Thus, such threats are less likely to be as technically credible as their nuclear equivalents.

He asserted that nuclear deterrence amounts to far less than its proponents have claimed and provocatively suggested that nuclear deterrence is a myth. Relying upon both empirical and theoretical objections to nuclear deterrence, he concluded that its failures were clear-cut and indisputable, whereas its successes were speculative. Yet in spite of a flourishing trade in scholarly articles, think tank reports, blog posts, and opinion pieces concerning nuclear deterrence, nobody—including nuclear weapons scholars—has ventured more than a limited critique of Wilson's essay. There are, however, serious shortcomings in Wilson's arguments—deficiencies that make his essay an unpersuasive brief against nuclear deterrence. Wilson's thesis could be correct. His arguments, however, are unlikely to persuade any skeptical members of Congress, upon whom future progress in arms control depends, to reconsider the value they attach to nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence.",The Nonproliferation Review,2012,19,1,51-68,"Culp, Derrin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029300653,0,

The perfectibility, rather than the existence of nuclear deterrence, is the paramount issue. The author also contends that in remaining fixated on civilian deaths and using Hiroshima and Nagasaki as his litmus test, Wilson fails to adequately consider whether there are other potential nuclear harms—fundamentally different in scale, scope, and moral and existential ramifications—that potentially can terrify societies enough to make nuclear deterrence a perfect or nearly perfect mode of security.",The Nonproliferation Review,2012,19,1,75-77,"Culp, Derrin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013277094,0,

Only in the mid-1980s did Mao’s legacy give way to concepts governing nuclear forces throughout the world and permit the development of China’s first nuclear strategy and acceptance of the principles of nuclear deterrence. Step by step, the ever-more complex command-and-control mechanisms of the People’s Liberation Army adopted and refined new roles for its nuclear and conventional missiles to support peacetime diplomacy, to manage military crises, and to pursue combat readiness. The authors examine the evolution of China’s overall defense strategy, with a focus on central elements of today’s nuclear war plan and how they are operationalized.

While terrorist organizations do not necessarily act uniformly or according to the same underlying beliefs, many of the most aggressive organizations are motivated by an ideology that embraces martyrdom and an apocalyptic vision.1 This ideology may be based on religion or a desire to overthrow a government. Consequently, terrorists motivated by ideology who intend to use a stolen or improvised nuclear device against the United States or its interests may not care about the resulting military repercussions following a nuclear attack. In such a scenario, some strategists think a terrorist organization's leadership may prove ""undeterrable"" by traditional military means. Nevertheless, deterrence is still a critical element in U.S. national strategy to prevent a nuclear attack.

For years, NATO'S plans have been based on the assumption that there would be a period of warning resulting from the deterioration of the international situation and overt activity on the part of the Warsaw Pact forces. Critchley examines the ability of NATO to predict and to respond to the Soviet - Warsaw Pact threat; he believes that NATO's defence must be credible without reliance upon warning, that warning signs are invariably misinterpreted, disbelieved and filtered by the preconceptions of the politicians. Not even the ability to read the enemy's codes is a guarantee of learning his intentions.

These threat mitigation strategies fall into different categories. IPv6 is a technical solution. Art of War is military. The third and fourth strategies are hybrid: deterrence is a mix of military and political considerations, while arms control is a political/technical approach. Technology and doctrine are the most likely strategies to provide short-term improvement in a nation’s cyber defense posture.

As nations struggle to defend their networks and infrastructure, their ability to apply the principles of deterrence to cyber activities correspondingly increases in importance. Cyber deterrence offers much more flexibility and increased options from traditional deterrence methodologies developed in the Cold War’s nuclear age. In addition to traditional retaliation, cyber deterrence includes options such as taking legal action; and making networks invisible, resilient, and interdependent. It also presents new ways to view and apply accepted methodologies such as invulnerability. As the U.S. continues to develop and implement cyber deterrence strategies and capabilities, there are important legal issues that require consideration, including international law, the law of armed conflict, and U.S. domestic law. This paper will identify and discuss six prominent theories of cyber deterrence and briefly analyze legal issues associated with this vital area of national security.

Given the nature of the conflicts in which the United States is engaged, attention today in defense circles focuses on counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and high-level conventional conflict. So stark has the shift been that a blue-ribbon panel, appointed in the wake of embarrassing incidents within the US nuclear bomber force, found “a serious erosion of focus, expertise, mission readiness, resources, and discipline in the nuclear weapons enterprise within the Air Force” and a general lack of interest in nuclear matters within the Defense Department as a whole.2 The broader intellectual climate has been even less favorable than the neglect suffered within the defense community. Indeed, much of the focus that nuclear deterrence has received in recent years has been generated by the well-publicized effort to eliminate nuclear weapons, an effort that in one way or another has received the endorsement of President Obama and his Republican 2008 rival Senator John McCain, legions of former senior officials, as well as countless cultural, religious, and other influential figures. Someone not steeped in the intricacies of nuclear deterrence might be forgiven for thinking that the broader military’s lack of interest in nuclear deterrence and the testimonies against its necessity by its former high priests and practitioners, like Henry Kissinger, constitute pretty powerful evidence that nuclear deterrence is no longer relevant—or even needed.",Deterrence,2012,,,49-73,"Colby, Elbridge",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018118160,1,"[Snyder, Glenn Herald]|[]||1961||||10.1515/9781400877164|pub.1018970969|179;[Herz, John H.]|[]|World Politics|1950|2|2|157-180|10.2307/2009187|pub.1026685744|310;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]||2003||||10.1057/9780230379435|pub.1035730468|74;[Blackwill, Robert D.; Legro, Jeffrey W.]|[ur.012270406324.40; ]|International Security|1989|14|3|68|10.2307/2538932|pub.1069980568|5;[Huntington, Samuel P.]|[]|International Security|1993|17|4|68|10.2307/2539022|pub.1069980637|106;[Smith, Adam]|[]|The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith, Vol. 2: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol. 1|1776||||10.1093/oseo/instance.00043218|pub.1087190994|4977;[Gilpin, Robert]|[]||1981||||10.1017/cbo9780511664267|pub.1098666815|1455;[Wendt, Alexander]|[]||1999||||10.1017/cbo9780511612183|pub.1098709857|2255;[Creveld, Martin van]|[ur.012333253301.99]||1999||||10.1017/cbo9780511497599|pub.1098738475|172;[Gilpin, Robert]|[]||2001||||10.1515/9781400831272|pub.1122267201|373;[Sagan, Scott Douglas]|[]||1993||||10.1515/9780691213064|pub.1127964851|240"

However, as Lavoy argues, national insecurity is a necessary but insufficient condition for nuclear proliferation.1 Other important factors include notions of ‘prestige’ and political power, domestic political dynamics, technological determinism, and the cognitive frameworks and disposition of national leaders.2 This applies equally to nuclear retention. Much of the debate on Trident replacement has centred on nuclear deterrence and cost. But there are deeper dynamics that revolve around conceptions of national identity that drive the UK’s determination to stay in the nuclear weapons business for many decades to come. Peter Hennessey has argued that successive Prime Ministerial decisions to develop and maintain the UK’s nuclear armoury have historically rested on a ‘gut decision’ that it was ‘right’ for the country. He says, paraphrasing Michael Quinlan, that ‘each set of decision-makers faced with the question of upgrading or carrying on has produced “a set of rationales to clothe that gut decision”.",A Nuclear Weapons-Free World?,2012,,,74-91,"Ritchie, Nick",University of York,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034805759,0,

Dreams have even provided the fuel for global initiatives. Who would have thought that Global Zero—the movement to end nuclear warheads—would have achieved so much success in a short span of five years or so? Its success may have been in part sparked by the now famous article in the WSJ in January of 2007 by the “four horsemen of the apocalypse,” Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, Bill Perry, and George Shultz. These men had been firm backers of nuclear deterrence, but they then changed tack to argue that nuclear weapons could no longer be considered a deterrence but had instead become the greatest risk of a global war. The dream of Bruce Blair and Matt Brown to launch Global Zero coupled with the warning of the four senior statesmen has helped reduce the number of nuclear warheads held by Russia and the United States to a level unimaginable only five years ago in 2006.

Sa pensée n’est pas systématique comme celle du stratège prussien, mais elle éclaire le contexte stratégique contemporain sur trois points. Son approche des systèmes internationaux conduit d’abord à définir le système actuel comme multipolaire et hétérogène. Sa typologie des guerres montre ensuite que la guerre interétatique se trouve débordée depuis 1945 par la dissuasion nucléaire et les guérillas. Son approche des rapports entre démocratie et guerre met enfin en lumière une dissonance entre les principes libéraux qui gouvernent les démocraties occidentales à l’intérieur et le caractère hégémonique de leur intervention militaire à l’extérieur. Abstract As a theoretician, Aron was, like Clausewitz, keen to understand the nature of war. He was also an attentive witness to the ways in which war changed. While his thought is not as systematic as the Prussian thinker’s, it nevertheless sheds light on the contemporary strategic context in three ways. First, his approach to international relations leads to the definition of the current system as multipolar and heterogeneous. Second, his typology of war reveals that interstate war has, since 1945, all but been replaced by nuclear deterrence and guerilla warfare. Finally, his analysis of the relationship between democracy and war brings to light a tension between the principles of liberty that define western democracy domestically and the hegemonic character of their military interventions on the international scene. Resumen Aron, como Clausewitz, es un teórico preocupado por la comprensión de la naturaleza de la guerra y un testigo atento a sus cambios y mutaciones. A pesar de que su pensamiento no es tan sistemático como el del estratega prusiano, es de gran utilidad para la comprensión del contexto estratégico contemporáneo. Primero, su enfoque de los sistemas internacionales permite definir el sistema actual como multipolar y heterogéneo. Segundo, su tipología de las guerras permite demostrar que la guerra interestatal fue remplazada a partir de 1945 por la disuasión nuclear y la guerra de guerrillas.

pub.1023816332,10.1017/cbo9781139096836.013,Regional security practices and Russian–Atlantic relations,"In this chapter I argue that regions in world politics are constituted by sets of specific ways of doing things – practices – that create more or less ordered spaces and narratives of regional interaction. Because they are socially meaningful and organized patterns of action, practices have structuring effects on politics. At the regional level of analysis, security practices such as war, deterrence, diplomacy, arms control, and military exchanges generate configured fields of interaction with variable degrees of order. Security communities, for example, are constituted by the self-evident practice of diplomacy. Likewise, regional nuclear deterrence is made possible by a limited set of patterned gestures – weapons deployment, summit diplomacy, rhetorical formulas, disarmament talks, and so forth – that organize the security game in mutually intelligible terms. As the case of post-Cold War Russian–Atlantic relations makes clear, however, regional security practices do not always form coherent and well-ordered wholes. Quite often, regional configurations are comprised of competing ways of doing things. This practice clash may lead to unstable security dynamics in which the meanings of interaction are contested or at least not mutually recognized. The case of NATO–Russia politics is particularly evocative here. In the early 1990s both former enemies appeared to be seeking to transform regional security practices from Cold War realpolitik to a new game of cooperative security and democratic peace. But the practices that each side enacted to that end were generally encountered by the other as a continuation of the past instead of a call for change. NATO’s enlargement, to take the most prominent example, was linked back to containment practices in Moscow. Reciprocally, Russia’s reactions to expansion, particularly during the negotiations of the 1997 Founding Act with the Alliance, were construed as outdated superpower diplomacy in Brussels. As a result, respective security practices partly failed to constitute a new pattern of regional order. Although some change occurred, as evidenced by new practices of seminar diplomacy or joint military exercises, twenty years after the end of the Cold War Russian–Atlantic relations remain structured by a combination of competing practices that do not always sit easily with each other.",International Relations Theory and Regional Transformation,2012,,,210-230,"Pouliot, Vincent",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023816332,5,
pub.1032197437,10.1017/cbo9781139096836.006,Neoclassical realism and the study of regional order,"Introduction T. V. Paul observes in this volume’s introduction that regional transformation – the conditions under which some geographically delimited regions are more likely to evolve toward greater cooperation and peaceful relations among their constituent states, while other regions remain trapped or degenerate into enduring rivalries and endemic interstate and intrastate war – is “of the utmost importance for crafting appropriate policy initiatives.” He defines a region as “a cluster of states that are proximate to each other and are interconnected in spatial, cultural, and ideational terms in a significant and distinguishable manner.” Regions, therefore, are a defined subsystem within a broader international (or interstate) system. According to Robert Jervis, we are dealing with a system when there are (a) a set of units or elements interconnected so that changes in some elements or their relationships produce changes in other parts of the system, and (b) the entire system exhibits properties and behaviors that are different from those of the constituent parts. Further, as Barry Buzan points out, “regions” are recent historical phenomena. The existence of a single international system of a sufficient geographic scope and interaction capacity to comprise multiple regions only dates to the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. Between 1848 and 1945 Prussia and its successor state Germany initiated six interstate wars, the Schleswig–Holstein wars of 1848–49 and 1862, the 1866 Austro-Prussian (or Seven Weeks’) War, the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War, World War I, and World War II. During approximately the same period Japan initiated five wars: the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the Manchurian (or Mukden) Incident of 1931, the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937–41, and the Pacific theater of World War II. Yet since their respective defeats in 1945, neither Germany nor Japan has threatened to use force, let alone actually gone to war, against its neighbors. Western Europe has not experienced an interstate war, let alone a major (or hegemonic) war, in almost seventy years. Similarly, since the Korean War armistice in 1953, there have been no full-fledged great power wars in East Asia, although there have been a number of crises that risked escalation to war, most recently the 1995–96 Taiwan Strait Crisis. There have been four instances since 1945 where China has gone to war, albeit against adversaries outside of Northeast Asia or against great powers that intervened in existing conflicts in the region. These include China’s intervention in the Korean War in 1950–53, the Sino-Indian War in 1962, Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, and the Sino-Soviet border clashes in 1969. For a variety of reasons – nuclear deterrence, the bipolar distribution of power in the global system, and power asymmetries between combatants – none of those conflicts escalated to a regional level. Nonetheless, compared to the respective dynamics in the pre-1945 (or pre-1953) era and compared to other regions of the globe today, both Western Europe and East Asia have been remarkably stable.",International Relations Theory and Regional Transformation,2012,,,74-104,"Taliaferro, Jeffrey W.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032197437,3,

Secondly, I argue that the morally superior and politically efficacious counter-nuclear terrorist response is to hunt down the nuclear terrorists and hold them accountable for war crimes in the International Criminal Court. This response is consistent with just war theoretic principles, and it also affirms the moral virtues of honor, dignity, and humane treatment in contexts where they are needed the most – the holocausts of nuclear terrorist attacks.",Journal of Military Ethics,2011,10,4,296-308,"Doyle, Thomas E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048923793,0,"[Mattox, John Mark]|[]|Journal of Military Ethics|2010|9|2|160-176|10.1080/15027570.2010.491340|pub.1020860244|1;[Doyle, Thomas E.]|[ur.011013370276.47]|International Theory|2010|2|1|87-112|10.1017/s1752971909990248|pub.1054945198|6;[Gauthier, David]|[]|Ethics|1984|94|3|474-495|10.1086/292561|pub.1058602588|31;[Tucker, Robert W.]|[]|Ethics|1985|95|3|461-478|10.1086/292654|pub.1058602681|7;[Lee, Steven]|[]|Ethics|1985|95|3|549-566|10.1086/292659|pub.1058602686|8;[Kavka, Gregory S.]|[]|The Journal of Philosophy|1978|75|6|285|10.2307/2025707|pub.1069704352|39;[Margalit, Avishai]|[ur.015776231633.44]||2009||||10.1515/9781400831210|pub.1096995657|35;[Kant, Immanuel; Wood, Allen W.]|[; ]||1996||||10.1017/cbo9780511813306|pub.1098680529|419;[Sageman, Marc]|[]||2008||||10.9783/9780812206784|pub.1099535065|428"

This claim is based on three key arguments. First, that the positive effects of extended nuclear deterrence have been exaggerated by its proponents; second, that the rational actor logic underpinning extended nuclear deterrence is increasingly redundant; and third, that extended deterrence using conventional weapons is equally, if not more, effective as extended nuclear deterrence. This article applies these arguments to East Asia, a region where nuclear weapons continue to loom large in states' security equations. In applying each of the above arguments to the East Asian context, the analysis finds that not only is extended nuclear deterrence alive and kicking in the region, but also that in the coming decades it is likely to become more central to the strategic policies of the United States and its key allies, Japan and South Korea. Despite predictions of its demise, US extended nuclear deterrence remains a critical element in East Asia's security order and will remain so for the foreseeable future.",International Affairs,2011,87,6,1439-1457,"O'NEIL, ANDREW",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014930538,2,

Since 1991 gravity bombs, deliverable by US and allied dual-capable aircraft, have been the only type of US nuclear weapons left in Europe. Although many other factors are involved in the alliance's deterrence posture and in US extended deterrence—including intercontinental forces, missile defences, non-nuclear capabilities and declaratory policy—recent discussions in the United States about NATO nuclear deterrence have focused on the future of the remaining US nuclear weapons in Europe. The traditional view has supported long-standing US and NATO policy in holding that the risk- and responsibility-sharing arrangements based on US nuclear weapons in Europe contribute to deterrence and war prevention; provide assurance to the allies of the genuineness of US commitments; and make the extended deterrence responsibility more acceptable to the United States. From this perspective, no further cuts in the US nuclear weapons presence in Europe should be made without an agreement with Russia providing for reductions that address the US—Russian numerical disparity in non-strategic nuclear forces, with reciprocal transparency and verification measures. In contrast, four schools of thought call for withdrawing the remaining US nuclear weapons in Europe without any negotiated Russian reciprocity: some military officers who consider the weapons and associated arrangements unnecessary for deterrence; proponents of ambitious arms control measures who accept extended deterrence policies but view the US weapons in Europe as an obstacle to progress in disarmament; nuclear disarmament champions who reject extended nuclear deterrence policies and who wish to eliminate all nuclear arms promptly; and selective engagement campaigners who want the United States to abandon extended nuclear deterrence commitments to allies on the grounds that they could lead to US involvement in a nuclear war.",International Affairs,2011,87,6,1401-1438,"YOST, DAVID S.",Naval Postgraduate School,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047271019,5,

Since 1991 the United States has also reduced its nonstrategic nuclear weapons by over 90 percent. Additionally, the United States removed much of its nuclear arsenal from alert status and continues to decrease its nuclear weapons stockpiles. However, nuclear weapons may still play an important role in deterring an adversary attack against the United States as well as providing a nuclear umbrella to allies. An extended nuclear deterrent for protecting allies may also contribute significantly to nonproliferation efforts- the nuclear umbrella provides allies an assurance so they do not perceive the need to develop nuclear weapons arsenals for themselves. This study explores the impact of US nuclear weapon policy on the current and future effectiveness of extended nuclear deterrence for the Republic of Turkey.

Currently, little overlap exists between the two, although that might change in the aftermath of an extensive, destructive cyberattack. The most effective way to protect the cyber-dependent infrastructure is a comprehensive defense (deterrence by denial), which was impractical in the nuclear regime.

This article argues from a Bourdieusian viewpoint that scientific arguments and ‘facts’ are at work in at least three distinct mechanisms within and around securitization. First, science communities/explanations can come to objectify an issue to the extent where securitization – and even politicization – becomes next to impossible. Second, science co-determines the status of a securitizing actor and thus influences the authority of the speaker in specific fields. Third, scientific facts can be mobilized in securitization claims by securitizing actors in attempts to seek back-up in the objective, disinterested aura of the scientific vocation. The RAND Corporation’s objectivation of the issue of nuclear deterrence is taken as an example of the first mechanism, while climate change and democratic peace illustrate the other two mechanisms.

Three central questions of this study are as follows. First of all, what was the nature of the Truman Administration’s nuclear strategy before the Korean War? Secondly, what were the positions of the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations on the use of nuclear weapons and what were the main reasons for the non-use of the nuclear weapons during the Korean War? Thirdly, what impact did the Korean War have on the emergence of the Massive Retaliation Strategy? And what impact did the strategy have on the Korean peninsula subsequently. In answering these questions, this study seeks to highlight the reciprocal relationship between U.S. nuclear strategy and the Korean War, as one of the most crucial events in the formative years of nuclear deterrence.",Korea and World Politics,2011,27,2,89-118,"Yu, Jinseog",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002923295,0,

China is the only major nuclear power that has been actively expanding its offensive capabilities. Its nuclear modernization has inevitably caused concerns in the United States. The article suggests that China's nuclear programme is driven significantly by US missile defence, which has fundamentally altered the incentive structures for Chinese nuclear deterrence. The article also assesses the latest Chinese perception of US strategic adjustment under the Obama administration and its potential impact on arms control. It reveals that recent measures by the United States to restrain its missile defense could be conducive for achieving a strategic nuclear understanding between the two countries.

The theoretical inquiry into the current state of nuclear extended deterrence is followed by an examination of the necessity, viability and desirability of reformed versions of nuclear extended deterrence (such as collective deterrence), and of three conceivable generic alternatives to reliance upon nuclear extended deterrence: namely nuclear rejection, nuclear recession, and conventional deterrence (possibly combined with existential nuclear deterrence). A bilateral nuclear-weapon-free zone, with the door held open to North Korea to join at a later stage, would act as a circuit-breaker in the stalemated nuclear confrontation; prefigure a US negative security guarantee to North Korea in a future rapprochement; and reduce ongoing regional anxieties by locking both South Korea and Japan into a legally binding non-nuclear security posture.",Pacific Focus,2011,26,1,5-21,"Tanter, Richard; Hayes, Peter",Nautilus Institute,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001637076,1,"[Lebow, Richard Ned]|[ur.011434531375.46]|Security Dialogue|1986|17|2|107-112|10.1177/096701068601700202|pub.1003121653|15;[Cox, Robert W.]|[]|Millennium Journal of International Studies|1983|12|2|162-175|10.1177/03058298830120020701|pub.1011045413|486;[Pabian, Frank V.]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|1995|3|1|1-19|10.1080/10736709508436602|pub.1013786963|18;[Collina, Tom Zamore; de Souza Barros, Fernando]|[; ur.012730733611.42]|Korean Journal of Defense Analysis|1996|8|1|111-127|10.1080/10163279609464330|pub.1025956145|1;[Bull, Hedley]|[]||1977||||10.1007/978-1-349-24028-9|pub.1028572437|1681;[Walsh, Jim]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|1997|5|1|1-20|10.1080/10736709708436690|pub.1049444672|16;[Endicott, John E.]|[]|Korean Journal of Defense Analysis|2008|20|1|13-26|10.1080/10163270802006305|pub.1051414689|3;[Hamel‐Green, Michael]|[]|Pacific Focus|2011|26|1|90-112|10.1111/j.1976-5118.2011.01057.x|pub.1051454904|2;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]|Conflict Management and Peace Science|2006|23|2|121-138|10.1080/07388940600665768|pub.1058340666|2;[Tow, William T.]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|1989|104|1|117|10.2307/2150990|pub.1069791006|3;[Freedman, Lawrence; Halperin, Morton H.; McNamara, Robert]|[; ; ]|International Security|1988|13|1|177|10.2307/2538900|pub.1069980542|23;[Walker, R.

This paper analyzes the changing dynamics of US extended nuclear deterrence on the Korean peninsula since the eruption of the North Korean nuclear crisis. It focuses on the negative security assurance and explains how US extended nuclear deterrence for South Korea is adversely affected by the new negative security assurance of the Obama administration. It also investigates the history of security guarantees to North Korea provided by the USA and emphasizes how the USA's repeated security guarantees – in its attempt to denuclearize North Korea – have weakened the nuclear umbrella over South Korea. In addition, the paper points out that some policies of the USA at the negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis can only be explained by US politicians' drive for a positive political legacy. Therefore, some safeguard measures are necessary to supplement the diminishing US nuclear umbrella on the Korean peninsula. The unique threat to South Korea makes it a suitable place to actively apply the new concept of regionally tailored deterrence architecture and implement a dual-track approach to negotiations for resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis by preparing to redeploy US tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea.

Mutually Assured Destruction, the distinction between capabilities and intentions, and even linkage politics - all of those basic concepts are profoundly altered in the Israeli case by the (often conscious) presence of the Holocaust. The Holocaust’s influence is evident in the Israeli belief that deterring Iran might be impossible: MAD does not apply to the Iranians since, like Hitler, their regime is considered mad: its commitment to destructing the “Zionist entity” is understood as trumping any standard realpolitik calculations. This perception of Iran generates the conviction that the Iranian nuclear project must be stopped at all costs: Israel must prepare for the possibility that the Jews will once again be left alone and, if need be, launch a strike against Iran to prevent a potential second Holocaust.

In the wake of overt nuclearisation, the logic of nuclear deterrence in subcontinental security dynamics was also questioned because of continued security instability, evident in instances like the military impasse of 2001–2002. Hence, the subject of nuclearisation of subcontinental security began to capture wider spaces in the political debates in India. This strategic decision, having been taken by a coalition government, imparted enormous complexities to the domestic political exchanges over the security dynamics of the subcontinent.

pub.1114887839,10.11375/kokusaiseiji.163_1,Nuclear Power and Pax Americana,"Nuclear weapons were an integral part of the US arsenal in the Cold War years. Successive administrations relied on the enormously destructive power of these weapons for the defense of the Western Bloc. The US government, maintaining a final voice in employing nuclear weapons in contingency, rejected its allies' request that the weapons not be used from their bases without prior approval. Nuclear power was also utilized, however, to cement ties with its allies by offering bilateral agreements for the peaceful use of this source of energy. While engaged in the nuclear arms race, the US and the USSR shared a common interest in averting war and preventing nuclear proliferation; both nations began nuclear test ban negotiations in the latter half of the 1950s. The PTBT of 1963 and the NPT of 1968 were two treaties that resulted from these negotiations. Throughout the Cold War years, nuclear mutual deterrence between the two superpowers was maintained, and the NPT was largely successful in controlling nuclear proliferation. The US was estimated to have spent $5.5 trillion on nuclear weapons, which represented almost 29% of all military spending in the Cold War period. The US bore the staggering cost of nuclear weapons regardless of their inherent risk so as to insure Pax America. With the end of the Cold War, nuclear deterrence against the USSR lost its military validity while the accelerating spread of nuclear weapons became a matter of serious concern. Iraq was reported to have reached an advanced stage of nuclear development, only to have that capability negated by the Gulf War; India, Pakistan, and North Korea, however, succeeded in declaring themselves in possession of nuclear weapons. The danger that “rogue states” and international terrorist organizations might attain and use nuclear weaponry came to loom large for America. 9/11 gave the G.W. Bush administration a sense of tremendous urgency in the matter of dealing with the issue of nuclear proliferation. Actually, the war against Iraq was waged under the pretext of eliminating weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein allegedly had produced. The proposal that H. Kissinger, G. Shultz, W. Perry and S. Nunn made in January 2007 calling for a world without nuclear weapons should be understood in this altered strategic context. Stressing the significance of coping with the threat of nuclear proliferation, these four highly prominent experts on nuclear strategy proposed the elimination of nuclear weapons. In the same vain, President Obama made a celebrated address in Prague in April 2009; his speech's major emphasis lay on nuclear disarmament and prevention of nuclear proliferation. Nuclear weapons, which had brought about a certain stability and predictability in US-Soviet relations and helped insure Pax America, has now come to constitute the most pressing threat to US security.

Both unipolarity and nuclear weapons have been subject to extensive analysis. Virtually every treatment of contemporary unipolarity makes reference to nuclear weapons, but virtually no analysis of nuclear weapons considers unipolarity. Exploring the impact of nuclear weapons on unipolarity would seem straightforward enough, but in reality is very complicated because theorists disagree about so many important aspects of both nuclear weapons and unipolarity. Theorizing about nuclear weapons has been a central part of international theory for more than six decades. While there are still some outliers, theorists of the effects of nuclear weapons on international politics have a near consensus on the central importance of nuclear deterrence. Dispute remains about what is necessary to achieve deterrence, and how prone it is to failure. But the proposition that nuclear weapons deter conflicts by vastly raising the cost of war is both theoretically robust and widely held. According to this view nuclear deterrence has made international politics much more peaceful than in pre-nuclear times.

Perceived security threats and the preferred means for dealing with them are in part derived from people’s preferences for how basic social relationships should be structured and maintained. This paper focuses on the ways in which fundamental world-views, following Mary Douglas’ and Aaron Wildavsky’s conception of cultural theory (CT), shape perceived risks in the international arena, including preferred responses to terrorist threats and preferences for US nuclear deterrence capabilities. Of particular interest is how CT measures perform when compared to more traditional political variables, such as political ideology or partisanship. The data for this analysis are taken from a set of nationwide US public surveys (telephone and Internet based) with common sets of questions taken in 1995, 2008, and 2009. Overall the dataset includes over 6,167 individual interviews. The data permit analysis of the ways in which measures of CT orientations (hierarchy, egalitarianism, and individualism), political ideology and partisanship shape perceptions of perceived risks (and benefits) and an array of policy preferences in the international arena. We find that the CT measures perform quite well in comparison to more traditional partisan and ideological measures. Of particular interest is our finding that, depending on the nature of the issue, individualists align sometimes with hierarchs and at other time with egalitarians.

States can create several incentives for improved collaboration with allies and private sector partners. States can derive mutual benefits from shared intelligence; shared standards for risk assessment; joint exercises; and standby arrangements for crucial information, equipment, materials, and services.

This awesome capacity was offered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt by Albert Einstein and other leading scientific minds out of the grim realization that it might otherwise fall into the hands of Nazi Germany, and it was used by President Harry Truman to bring the war with Japan to an immediate conclusion.

Would the return of multipolarity increase the prospects for war? Although unipolarity has been marked by very low levels of militarized competition among major powers, many scholars doubt whether the association is causal. Mainstream theories of war long ago abandoned the notion of any simple relationship between polarity and war, positing that conflict emerges from a complex interaction between power and dissatisfaction with the status quo. “While parity defines the structural conditions where war is most likely,” one team of prominent power transition theorists notes, “the motivation driving decisions for war is relative satisfaction with the global or regional hierarchy.” High levels of dissatisfaction may prompt states to take on vastly superior rivals. To explain the low levels of conflict since 1991, therefore, scholars must look beyond the distribution of capabilities to account for the absence of such dissatisfaction. To most observers, moreover, satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the status quo among today's great powers appear to be driven by factors having little or nothing to do with the system's polarity. “For most scholars,” writes Robert Jervis, “the fundamental cause of war is international anarchy, compounded by the security dilemma. These forces press hardest on the leading powers because while they may be able to guarantee the security of others, no one can provide this escape from the state of nature for them.” But for today's leading powers anarchy-induced security problems appear to be ameliorated by nuclear deterrence, the spread of democracy, the declining benefits of conquest, and changing collective ideas, among other factors. In combination, these factors appear to moderate insecurity and resulting clashes over the status quo, which most scholars believe drive states to war. Mainstream theories of war thus seem irrelevant to what Jervis terms an “era of leading power peace.”",International Relations Theory and the Consequences of Unipolarity,2011,,,33-66,"Wohlforth, William C.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028318311,1,
pub.1091517498,10.21236/ada536155,A Risk-Based Approach to Strategic Balance (Carlisle Papers),"The United States requires a national security strategy and a force posture that reflect the nation's economic and emotional capacity to implement the strategy. Recently published strategic concepts fail to accommodate these requirements. Current Secretary of Defense guidance to the Services is to develop a strategically balanced joint force capable of spanning the full spectrum of conflict. The U.S. Joint Forces Command interpretation of the Department of Defense vision is to expand military capability in an economic environment where defense budgets will almost certainly contract. In response, U.S. Joint Force and Army Capstone Concepts articulate development of a force that is not optimized toward specific threats but rather depends on rapid adaptability to threats as they are revealed. These concepts demand vigorous debate on their risk and affordability implications. This paper explores a risk-based approach to a strategically balanced force that assesses alternative postures and the viability of competing force concepts in mitigating national risk in a resource-constrained environment. This assessment also examines alternate definitions of balance and the continued relevance of U.S. conventional capabilities and nuclear deterrence.",,2010,,,,"Mauk, John A.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091517498,0,
pub.1091746424,10.21236/ada570463,"The New Triad (Counterproliferation Paper, Number 55)","On April 5, 2009 President Obama introduced his vision of reducing nuclear dangers and overcoming grave and growing threats by seeking the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. 1 Whether or not this is an obtainable goal or even in the National Security Interests of the U.S., reducing the number of nuclear weapons is a plausible endeavor. As stated in the third objective of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) the U.S. must continue maintaining strategic deterrence and stability at reduced nuclear force levels. 2 Additionally, the U.S. must continue to provide assurance to allies who are covered under the U.S. nuclear deterrence umbrella. More significant reductions are possible through a mindset change regarding the traditional nuclear triad consisting of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and nuclear bombers. Specifically, this paper proposes a new version of the nuclear triad one centered on hardened mobile ICBMs as a means to a survivable nuclear deterrent on the road to zero. In fact, it is possible to substantially reduce the number of nuclear weapons well below new START numbers and still maintain national security. The existing nuclear triad may presently provide an effective deterrent against Russia, and other nuclear weapon states. However, U.S. security could be compromised if we agree to much deeper cuts in strategic forces in future arms control agreements and, after having done so, Russia once again becomes an adversary perhaps after a new crisis in Georgia, Ukraine, or one of the Baltic states. As I demonstrate in the following pages, an economical way to enhance survivability and account for such a strategic development is to revisit the Midgetman a concept that has already been designed and tested.",,2010,,,,"Peterson, Marc A",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091746424,0,

pub.1027332249,10.1177/0047117810377278,The Quirks of Nuclear Deterrence,"From 1945 to 1949 the USA was the world’s only nuclear power. Although the nuclear arsenal was overestimated both in terms of size and readiness by the US military in its war plans, atom bombs came to be seen as the essential counter to conventional Soviet forces. The USSR constructed its own bombs in turn, and for decades the analysis of nuclear deterrence was almost exclusively concerned with the two superpowers. In the twenty-first century, the nuclear world no longer displays that mirror-image symmetry and can now be viewed as unipolar, regional, multipolar or stateless. Nuclear deterrence that seemed such an established technical reality during the Cold War should be recognized as a psychological construct that depends on threat perception and cultural attitudes, as well as the values, rationality and strength of political leaders who themselves have to mediate between groups with vested economic or military interests. As the number of nuclear weapons states increases, the logic of nuclear deterrence becomes less obvious and it should not be casually invoked as a general security factor without regard to a specific context. Nuclear weapons have become emblems of geopolitical power under the guise of deterrence. We argue that nuclear deterrence is meaningless against extremist terrorists. Our survey of its quirks leads us to believe that nuclear deterrence is a far less foolproof and reliable global security mechanism than many assume.",International Relations,2010,24,3,293-312,"Brown, Andrew; Arnold, Lorna",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027332249,1,

I suggest that an emerging wave of literature currently represents a revival in this field. However, unlike the previous waves, in which theoretical and empirical questions were studied together (realism and nuclear deterrence), in the emerging deterrence literature these two are isolated from each other. The theoretical trend of this wave is evident in new constructivist and interpretative scholarship that explores the practices of deterrence and has provided significant insights, chiefly with regard to classical empirical questions of state versus state and nuclear deterrence. The empirical trend of this wave can be seen through the work of scholars who are considering how to deter “new” threats—such as terrorism, rogue states, and ethnic conflicts—mainly by incorporating the traditional realist approach to deterrence. By reviewing these two trends in the current wave of deterrence writing, I demonstrate the advantages of each and suggest that the study of deterrence may benefit from their integration.",International Studies Quarterly,2010,54,3,705-732,"Lupovici, Amir",Tel Aviv University,Israel,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014733017,34,"[Harvey, Frank]|[]|Security Studies|1997|6|3|180-210|10.1080/09636419708429318|pub.1000103914|11;[Press‐Barnathan, Galia]|[ur.015465107631.61]|International Studies Review|2004|6|2|195-212|10.1111/j.1521-9488.2004.00395.x|pub.1001730455|8;[Cioffi-Revilla, Claudio]|[ur.013027716224.13]|Cross-Cultural Research|1999|33|3|239-264|10.1177/106939719903300302|pub.1002101264|5;[Danilovic, Vesna]|[ur.014573655777.46]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|2001|45|1|97-125|10.1177/0022002701045001005|pub.1003659149|17;[CRAWFORD, TIMOTHY W.]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|2001|116|4|499-523|10.2307/798219|pub.1004207007|14;[Cortell, Andrew P.;

pub.1010908793,10.1080/10163271.2010.500027,India and Pakistan: a case of asymmetric nuclear deterrence,"Ever since decolonization and the partition of the former British colony of India into the states of India and Pakistan, there has been an enduring conflict between them, which has resulted in various crises. It has continued despite dramatic changes in the geopolitical environment. The conflict is over national identity, territory, and the power position in the region. The Pakistani elite have been unable to accept the division of Jamma and Kashmir and seek equal status with India, while India sees itself as a great power in the region. The conflict escalated into war at the very creation of the state of Pakistan in 1947–48, as well as in 1965 and 1971. The war in 1971 resulted in the division of Pakistan, a defeat that instilled a great sense of insecurity in Pakistan and a greater determination to find a way to overcome India's military superiority. In order to balance India's conventional military superiority, Pakistan acquired a small-scale nuclear weapons capability using bombers and medium-range missiles as delivery vehicles. Already by 1974, India had a significant nuclear industry and had demonstrated its capacity to explode nuclear devices. Whereas Pakistan's nuclear weapons doctrine is Indo-centric, India acquired a nuclear capability as part of an ambition to be recognized as a great power and seeks to deter not only Pakistan but also China. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by both India and Pakistan raises the specter of a regional nuclear conflict with catastrophic consequences. However, there is a widespread view in the strategic studies community that nuclear weapons are likely to prevent armed conflict due to the effects of nuclear deterrence and the unacceptable risks that the protagonists face in the event of war. In the case of Indo-Pak relations, however, nuclearization seems to have had the opposite effect, as the frequency of the crises has increased since both countries became declared nuclear powers. This paper is concerned with the effect of nuclear weapons on the security crisis in South Asia. The literature on the Indo-Pak conflict generally agrees that the stability of the strategic nuclear relationship is the key factor in explaining the phenomenon of the increasing frequency of crises since both countries have been acknowledged as nuclear powers. The majority of scholars claim that the strategic relationship is stable and that this stability creates a strategic space for Pakistan to initiate conflict at a conventional level. An alternative view expressed in the literature is that the strategic nuclear relationship between Pakistan and India is not stable and that the conflict is driven by this instability—in other words that the real risk of nuclear escalation gives Pakistan confidence that India will be deterred from employing its superiority at the conventional level. This paper argues that the endeavors by scholars to explain the Indo-Pak conflict on the basis of strategic stability or instability are unconvincing. The strategic studies literature asserts that strategic stability exists if two protagonists have a secure second-strike capability that is sufficiently large to inflict unacceptable damage on the opponent and thus can deter aggression. The paper argues that the strategic nuclear relationship between Pakistan and India is not stable and that deterrence of conflict between the two states is not stable. The behaviors of the protagonists cannot be explained on the basis of the balance of their nuclear and conventional capabilities, but instead are the products of strategic cognitive dissonance. This means that there is a serious risk of conflict escalating to the nuclear level.",Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,2010,22,3,387-406,"Bluth, Christoph",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010908793,0,

Having long downplayed the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s capabilities and aims, China is now publicizing its capacity to inflict damage while cultivating uncertainty about its precise intentions to induce caution in adversaries. Key dimensions of China's RMA include complementary kinetic and information attacks and the substitution of ‘information deterrence’ for nuclear deterrence. Contrary to earlier analyses focused on a decisive surprise strike, current journal articles emphasize the need for ‘serialized’ information and kinetic attacks. Chinese strategists may err in three ways, however: They may underestimate US resilience; they may overestimate the PLA's ability to conduct ‘warfare engineering’; and China's peacetime preparations for the RMA may incite an unexpected response.",Journal of Strategic Studies,2010,33,4,483-504,"Newmyer, Jacqueline",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026957644,26,"[Adamsky, Dima P]|[ur.07521165351.80]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2008|31|2|257-294|10.1080/01402390801940443|pub.1018939568|9;[Newmyer, Jacqueline]|[]|Orbis|2009|53|2|205-219|10.1016/j.orbis.2009.01.010|pub.1046807884|11;[Cohen, Eliot A.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1996|75|2|37|10.2307/20047487|pub.1102760806|79"
pub.1013869759,10.1177/0967010610374310,Missile Defence Discourses and Practices in Relevant Modalities of 21st-Century Deterrence,"In recent considerations of deterrence in strategic studies, there are almost no works that would systematically link deterrence to one of the most important current issue areas of contemporary strategic studies: ballistic missile defence (BMD). In an attempt to address this lacuna, this article considers ways in which missile defence has been — and can be — intertwined with deterrence of the 21st century. The article begins with a historical outline of the relationship between nuclear deterrence and BMD, and continues by comparing and contrasting US political and strategic-planning discourses in how they have addressed the examined relationship. What follows is the recasting of traditional understanding of deterrence as a set of disparate modalities underpinned by different principles and organizing logics. The article will show the role and function of BMD in three relevant modalities of deterrence in the 21st century: first, in a renewed strategic deterrence between the USA and Russia based on an axiomatic logic of MAD; second, in the deterrence of rogue states in reaction to their asymmetric nuclear threats; and, finally, in a reverse deterrence from intervention in regional conflicts. Consequently, the presented outline of the three modalities will be theoretically furthered to allow for conceptualization of possible links to BMD in ways in which practical implications for future research, strategic planning and political action can be seen.",Security Dialogue,2010,41,4,435-459,"Hynek, Nik",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013869759,0,"[Dorff, Robert H.; Cerami, Joseph R.]|[; ]|Small Wars and Insurgencies|2000|11|2|109-123|10.1080/09592310008423281|pub.1002078300|2;[Council, Natural Resources Defense]|[ur.014150364347.51]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|2006|62|3|60-63|10.1080/00963402.2006.11460990|pub.1011994093|1;[Powell, Robert]|[]|International Security|2003|27|4|86-118|10.1162/016228803321951108|pub.1015346075|29;[Miller, Steven E.]|[]|Survival|2001|43|3|95-109|10.1080/00396330112331343065|pub.1018250192|9;[Snyder, Glenn Herald]|[]||1961||||10.1515/9781400877164|pub.1018970969|179;[Ross, Robert S.]|[]|International Security|2002|27|2|48-85|10.1162/016228802760987824|pub.1022603988|42;[Lebovic, James H.]|[]||2007||||10.4324/9780203089002|pub.1023234301|13;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|2005|28|5|751-763|10.1080/01402390500393837|pub.1033008975|8;[Egetmeyer, Markus; Hintze, Almut]|[; ]||1992||||10.1515/9783110853520|pub.1033106789|1975;[Urayama, Kori]|[]|Survival|2004|46|2|123-142|10.1093/survival/46.2.123|pub.1038114532|11;[Krepon, M.]|[]|Survival|2001|43|2|81-96|10.1093/survival/43.2.81|pub.1045868959|6;[Johnston, Alastair Iain]|[ur.012057106077.76]|International Security|1995|20|3|5|10.2307/2539138|pub.1069980715|57;[Huth, Paul; Russett, Bruce]|[ur.016301126663.22; ur.01244123154.27]|International Studies Quarterly|1988|32|1|29|10.2307/2600411|pub.1070020413|87;[Jablonsky, David]|[]||1991||||10.21236/ada243579|pub.1091767045|3;[Morgan, Patrick M.]|[]||2003||||10.1017/cbo9780511491573|pub.1098665879|78"

The incredible power of nuclear weapons gave birth to deterrence, a military strategy in which the purpose of armies shifted from winning wars to preventing them. Although cyber attacks per se do not compare to a nuclear explosion, they do pose a serious and increasing threat to international security. Real-world examples suggest that cyber warfare will play a lead role in future international conflicts. This article examines the two deterrence strategies available to nation-states (denial and punishment) and their three basic requirements (capability, communication, and credibility) in the light of cyber warfare. It also explores whether the two most challenging aspects of cyber attacks – attribution and asymmetry – will make cyber attack deterrence an impossible task.",Computer Law & Security Review,2010,26,3,298-303,"Geers, Kenneth",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033025093,32,"[Mishra, Shitanshu]|[]|Strategic Analysis|2003|27|4|546-562|10.1080/09700160308450107|pub.1002282060|1;[Geers, Kenneth]|[]|Information Security Journal A Global Perspective|2009|18|1|1-7|10.1080/19393550802676097|pub.1018890904|11;[Sartori, Leo; Tsipis, Kosta]|[; ]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1983|39|6|40-47|10.1080/00963402.1983.11459010|pub.1034370561|2;[Chamberlain, Lawrence H.; Dunn, Frederick S.; Brodie, Bernard; Wolfers, Arnold; Corbett, Percy E.; Fox, William T.

The United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) confronted each other as military and ideological rivals heading competing alliance systems—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), founded in 1949, and the Warsaw Pact established in 1955. Nuclear weaponry added a new wrinkle to the global superpower competition, particularly after the Soviet Union broke the American nuclear monopoly in 1949. A rich literature around these themes emerged as scholars sought to grapple with the explanatory dynamics propelling state behavior under the systemic constraints of bipolarity and the technological challenges presaged by the nuclear age. Such an academic focus meant that the study of international politics, particularly in the United States, was largely refracted through the prism of U.S.-Soviet competition and centered on the nature and implications of polarity, power, alliances, and nuclear deterrence. When the Soviet Union imploded, bipolarity in the sense of two predominant powers ended, as did the division of the world into two opposing blocs. In the post-Cold War period, scholars turned their attention to investigating questions regarding the impact on the nature of system structure and the international order of the collapse of one of the poles.  Accordingly, during the Cold War, scholars debated the conceptual and empirical understandings of bipolarity as well as its implications and the causal factors on which the expectation of bipolar stability was based. In the post-Cold War period, scholars reflected over whether the end of ideological (capitalism/democracy vs. communism/single party authoritarianism) conflict presaged the end of history or inaugurated a clash of civilizations , with some questioning the salience of the concept of polarity and the viability of the state system in the face of rising subnational and transnational pressures.",Oxford Research Encyclopedia of International Studies,2010,,,,"Nadkarni, Vidya",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127357495,0,

India’s conventional military superiority vis-a-vis Pakistan and its credibility as a regional hegemon, apparent in the three open wars fought between them prior to this, got supplanted by the smoke-screen of nuclear deterrence created by these blasts. But, most significant by-product of this strategic-decision-making in the subcontinent has been, that, unlike US and USSR, whose mutual hostilities during the Cold War got mitigated after both had obtained declared nuclear weapons status; the sub-continental security environment continued to dizzy under the threshold of an imminent conflict even after the overt nuclear weaponization of India and Pakistan, ultimately challenging the entire classical theorizing on nuclear deterrence. Due to this, the subject of the nuclearization of sub-continental security architecture began to capture wider spaces in the scholarly discourses and political debates in India. This crucial strategic decision, having been taken by a coalition Government at New Delhi, imparted enormous complexities to the domestic political exchanges over the security dynamics of the subcontinent. Above all, May 1998 not only signified a paradigm shift in India’s defence and foreign policy, but it also marked a watershed in the nature and content of India’s domestic politics, as it contributed significantly in bringing strategic issues and foreign policy agenda of the Government into the political parlance of the common masses.",India Quarterly A Journal of International Affairs,2010,66,1,35-50,"H.M., Sanjeev Kumar",University of Allahabad,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063917001,1,"[Ganguly, Sumit]|[]|Studies in Conflict and Terrorism|1995|18|4|325-334|10.1080/10576109508435989|pub.1005804244|11;[Grugel, Jean]|[]|Government and Opposition|2003|38|2|238-264|10.1111/1477-7053.t01-1-00013|pub.1028353967|6;[Qadir, Shaukat]|[ur.010600672413.31]|The RUSI Journal|2002|147|2|24-30|10.1080/03071840208446752|pub.1040117209|11;[Pai, Sudha]|[]|Asian Survey|1998|38|9|836-852|10.2307/2645621|pub.1045658061|4;[]|[]|Microelectronics International|1999|Volume 16|Issue 2|20-23|10.1108/eum0000000004551|pub.1050554693|4"

Their activities have taken two main forms: the preparation of various state-sponsored reports investigating the utility and attendant dangers of nuclear weapons and making a strong case for nuclear disarmament; and the formation of like-minded groupings of states, namely in the New Agenda Coalition and the Seven-Nation Initiative, that are active in diplomatic forums and in practical projects. This article assesses the advocacy states' activities and shows that the states' reports and groupings increasingly focus on providing research, expertise, and technical assistance for the challenges facing disarmament. The article examines briefly the question of extended nuclear deterrence and disarmament (given that many of the advocacy states are Western allies) and considers the likely future role and activities for advocacy states.

Long traces the RAND Corporation's research on the subject, exploring the role that nuclear deterrence has played as a strategy of the Cold War. The author goes on to argue for the relevance of nuclear deterrence to the future strategic environment, considering threats from peer-competitors to non-state actors. By contrast Paul considers the rise and persistence of a tradition, or informal social norm, of non-use which has encouraged self-deterrence. Employing a series of examples, Paul argues that this tradition best explains why, since 1945, nuclear states have not used nuclear weapons against non-nuclear opponents. Taken together, these books encourage further consideration of the relationship between nuclear deterrence and the tradition of non-use. Indeed, it is difficult to see how the two practices can successfully coexist if non-nuclear states have, as Paul suggests, already begun to exploit the existence of a tradition of non-use.

The article considers the assurance roles of US nuclear forces in Europe, as well as elements of assurance in Washington's relations with its allies regarding extended nuclear deterrence. Whether the allies will retain the current requirements of extended deterrence and assurance in their new Strategic Concept or devise a new approach will be an issue of capital importance in the policy review launched at the Strasbourg/Kehl Summit.

By considering the case of worthwhile but hard-to-form ‘non-apocalyptic’ deterrent intentions (the threat to leave a cheating partner, say), the article argues that rational agents may be able to form such intentions by first simulating psychological states in which they have successfully formed them and then bootstrapping themselves into actually forming them.

A healthy understanding of the historical role of nuclear deterrence coupled with the examination of the last two NPRs reveals the necessity to revise the Department of Defense`s New Triad. This New Triad, introduced formally in the 2001 NPR, shifts the deterrence emphasis away from nuclear weapons to a combined approach to global deterrence based on global strike, defense and infrastructure capabilities. While this is a valuable approach for addressing the disparate and myriad threats to national security, it directs attention away from the nuclear mission and its unique role in national security. There have been two nuclear posture reviews accomplished since the end of the Cold War. Each of these NPRs failed to adequately resolve what the role of nuclear deterrence should be within the overall national security strategy. Rather than specifically addressing the unique role of nuclear deterrence they each in their own way shifted away from specific nuclear deterrence toward more generalized global deterrence. The next nuclear posture review has the opportunity to refocus the nation`s attention on the unique role of nuclear deterrence, particularly in light of the recent nuclear mishaps within the Department of Defense. An historical analysis of nuclear deterrence strategy and the recent nuclear posture reviews will aid in helping to address some of the root causes of the nuclear enterprise problems.

However, nuclear weapons may still play an important role in deterring an adversary attack against the United States and in providing a nuclear umbrella to allies. In fact, an extended nuclear deterrent for protecting allies also may contribute significantly to nonproliferation efforts-the nuclear umbrella provides an assurance to allies so they do not perceive the need to develop nuclear weapons arsenals for themselves.

But now, with the end of the Cold War and the rise of a new generation of security challenges, deterrence strategies need to be updated. This study examines one aspect of deterrence that has traditionally been overlooked - conventional deterrence. Our objective is to analyze how U.S. non-nuclear capabilities can be used to deter conventional aggression, and to examine the role of maritime power in preventing conventional conflicts.",,2009,,,,"Gerson, Michael; Whiteneck, Daniel",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091533181,0,

In particular, it challenges the assertion by Kenneth Waltz that “nuclear deterrence has passed all of the many tests it has faced” among regional rivals in South Asia. Examining two major regional military crises, this article notes that, first, nuclear deterrence was not the key factor ending these crises. Instead, nonnuclear factors involving American diplomacy, which provided the participants with timely exit strategies, ended the crises. Second, if these crisis-ending factors had not been present, there was a strong possibility of significant military escalation, and nuclear deterrence would not have averted such an escalation. The article concludes by noting that, in regions where deterrence optimism is not well supported, Washington may continue intervening in crises between nuclear rivals, and, anticipating such a U.S. approach, regional rivals could become involved in repeated military crises over the long term.",Security Studies,2009,18,1,148-182,"Mistry, Dinshaw",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004395999,1,

The article concludes that Israel’s leaders should promptly recall that their country confronts a nuclearizing Iran within a still-anarchic, “Westphalian” system of international relations and international law.

pub.1016676315,10.1111/j.1468-2346.2009.00782.x,Deterrence dogma? Challenging the relevance of British nuclear weapons,"In December 2006 the British government released a White Paper announcing its intention to begin the process of replacing its current Trident nuclear weapons system, thereby allowing it to retain nuclear weapons well into the 2050s. In March 2008 the government released its National Security Strategy that stressed the long-term complexity, diversity and interdependence of threats to British security with a clear focus on human rights, justice and freedom. This article asks how the threat to kill tens if not hundreds of thousands of people with British nuclear weapons fits into the National Security Strategy's world view and questions the relevance of an instrument of such devastating bluntness to threats defined by complexity and interdependence. It argues that the government's case for replacing the current Trident system based on the logic of nuclear deterrence is flawed. First, Britain faces no strategic nuclear threats and the long-term post-Cold War trend in relations with Russia and China—the two nuclear-armed major powers that could conceivably threaten the UK with nuclear attack—is positive, despite current tensions with Moscow over Georgia. Second, the credibility and legitimacy of threatening nuclear destruction in response to the use of WMD by ‘rogue’ states is highly questionable and British nuclear threats offer no ‘insurance’ or guarantee of protection against future ‘rogue’ nuclear threats. Third, nuclear weapons have no role to play in deterring acts of nuclear terrorism whether state-sponsored or not. Fourth, British nuclear threats will be useless in dealing with complex future conflicts characterized by ‘hybrid’ wars and diverse and interdependent sources of insecurity. The article concludes by arguing that the government's fall-back position that it must keep nuclear weapons ‘just in case’ because the future security environment appears so uncertain, makes no sense if British nuclear threats offer no solution to the causes and symptoms of that uncertainty.",International Affairs,2009,85,1,81-98,"RITCHIE, NICK",University of Bradford,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016676315,15,

pub.1025028850,10.1017/cbo9780511691805.007,Kargil: the nuclear dimension,"The Kargil conflict represents a landmark event in international nuclear history. Apart from the Sino-Soviet border clash of 1969, it is the only direct conflict between two states armed with nuclear weapons. Kargil also was the first overt conflict between India and Pakistan since the 1971 war established the state of Bangladesh and since both states openly demonstrated their nuclear capabilities in 1998. The Kargil conflict tested long-held assumptions regarding nuclear stability, deterrence, and the consequences of nuclear proliferation. It also provides important demonstrations of intelligence failure, the operation of the stability–instability paradox, and fundamental misperceptions regarding the intentions and capabilities of well-known adversaries. The key issue this essay analyzes is how the existence of nuclear forces affected the course of the Kargil conflict. Although nuclear weapons were not actually deployed in 1999, and although previous Indo-Pakistani crises had taken place under the shadow of emerging nuclear capabilities, the nuclear context of Kargil had three unprecedented effects on the strategic behavior of India, Pakistan, and outside parties, especially the United States. First, the achievement of mutual nuclear deterrence emboldened Pakistani military leaders to take assertive military action in Kashmir. Second, Indian elites believed that the nuclear revolution fundamentally changed Indo-Pakistani relations, and thus reacted in a slow and confused manner to the infiltration. As Pakistan's military role became apparent, India responded with unexpected vigor, both militarily and rhetorically.",Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia,2009,,,144-170,"Hoyt, Timothy D.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025028850,5,

It put a spotlight on widely held theories about the stabilizing, or destabilizing, properties of nuclear deterrence, at least at the low levels of nuclear arms and recessed deployment postures India and Pakistan were believed to have after their May 1998 nuclear tests. By the end of the Cold War, based on several decades of US–Soviet experience, most Western policymakers and military experts had become accustomed to the view that nuclear-armed adversaries would go to great lengths to avoid direct conventional military provocations for fear of escalation to a nuclear exchange. Pakistan's armed intrusion across the “line of control” (LoC) separating Pakistani and Indian forces in the disputed territory of Kashmir, and India's response, especially its moves to ready itself for horizontal military escalation, seemed to defy this conventional wisdom, generating new questions about the propensity of new nuclear states for risk-taking under the “nuclear shadow.” What lessons did US policymakers debate or take away from the Kargil crisis? In retrospect, the danger that the local conflict might spark a serious nuclear crisis was a key rationale for the US diplomatic intervention that defused the conflict, but how has that concern been translated since? Key US concerns since Kargil include the possibility that Pakistan and India have taken their own, quite different, lessons from their Kargil experience, storing up yet more dangers for the future.",Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia,2009,,,353-376,"Jones, Rodney W.; McMillan, Joseph",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033383700,0,

In fact the very nature of democracy demands that its citizens are not ignorant of the risks or costs associated with the various policies and decisions that our elected representatives make on our behalf; and perhaps no issue contains such critical risks and high costs as nuclear weapons.[1] There must be a clear public understanding of why we still have these weapons, how many we need, what they can and cannot do for us, and how our use or misuse of them will impact not only our own security, but in this increasingly globalized world, the inherently shared security of all people.

It has also often been used as a justification for possessing nuclear weapons. Nuclear deterrence, however, is based on an unexamined notion: the belief that the threat to destroy cities provides decisive leverage. An examination of history (including recent reinterpretations of the bombing of Hiroshima) shows that destroying cities rarely affects the outcome of wars. How is it possible that an action that is unlikely to be decisive can make an effective threat? Recent work on terrorism suggests that attacks against civilians are often not only ineffective but also counterproductive. And a review of the practical record of nuclear deterrence shows more obvious failures than obvious successes. Given this, the record of nuclear deterrence is far more problematic than most people assume.

What lessons do the intervening years hold regarding nuclear weapons' impact on South Asian security? Some scholars claim that nuclear weapons had a beneficial effect during this period, helping to stabilize historically volatile Indo-Pakistani relations. Such optimistic analyses of proliferation's regional security impact are mistaken, however. Nuclear weapons have had two destabilizing effects on the South Asian security environment. First, nuclear weapons' ability to shield Pakistan against all-out Indian retaliation, and to attract international attention to Pakistan's dispute with India, encouraged aggressive Pakistani behavior. This, in turn, provoked forceful Indian responses, ranging from large-scale mobilization to limited war. Although the resulting Indo-Pakistani crises did not lead to nuclear or full-scale conventional conflict, such fortunate outcomes were not guaranteed and did not result primarily from nuclear deterrence. Second, these Indo-Pakistani crises led India to adopt a more aggressive conventional military posture toward Pakistan. This development could exacerbate regional security-dilemma dynamics and increase the likelihood of Indo-Pakistani conflict in years to come.

Even though the 1999 crisis erupted into a war, its scope and dimensions were carefully circumscribed. Despite its conventional capabilities, India chose not to cross the Line of Control (the de facto international border in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir), and it avoided horizontal escalation of the conflict. India's restraint cannot be attributed either to timely U.S. intervention or to a concern about avoiding a bellicose international image. Instead a highly jingoistic regime, which had defied international public opinion the previous year through a series of nuclear tests, chose to exercise restraint because of Pakistan's possession of nuclear weapons. In 2001, despite grave Pakistani provocation through a series of terrorist attacks, India could only respond with a strategy of coercive diplomacy.",International Security,2008,33,2,45-70,"Ganguly, Sumit",Indiana University Bloomington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009999540,16,"[Acosta, Marcus P.]|[]|Small Wars and Insurgencies|2007|18|3|397-415|10.1080/09592310701674325|pub.1000222743|2;[Arquilla, John]|[]|Comparative Strategy|1997|16|1|13-31|10.1080/01495939708403090|pub.1001149294|6;[Hoyt, Timothy D.]|[]|Asian Survey|2001|41|6|956-977|10.1525/as.2001.41.6.956|pub.1002196983|9;[Carranza, Mario E]|[ur.011646762721.65]|International Politics|2003|40|3|313-339|10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800019|pub.1013697623|3;[Ahmed, Samina]|[]|International Security|1999|23|4|178-204|10.1162/isec.23.4.178|pub.1019498613|55;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|Asian Survey|2001|41|6|1064-1086|10.1525/as.2001.41.6.1064|pub.1024150388|11;[Raghavan, V.R.]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|2001|8|3|82-98|10.1080/10736700108436865|pub.1027876958|14;[Ganguly, umit]|[]|International Security|1999|23|4|148-177|10.1162/isec.23.4.148|pub.1028048962|59;[Ganguly, umit]|[]|International Security|1996|21|2|76-107|10.1162/isec.21.2.76|pub.1030046952|33;[Ladwig, Walter C.]|[ur.014031057715.41]|International Security|2008|32|3|158-190|10.1162/isec.2008.32.3.158|pub.1048968283|35;[Mansfield, Edward D.; Snyder, Jack]|[; ]|International Organization|2002|56|2|297-337|10.1162/002081802320005496|pub.1063348641|144;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|International Security|1994|18|4|66|10.2307/2539178|pub.1069980745|79;[Karl, David J.]|[]|International Security|1996|21|3|87|10.2307/2539274|pub.1069980804|33;[Ganguly, Sumit]|[]|Foreign Affairs|2000|79|2|2|10.2307/20049635|pub.1102762648|4;[Stern, Jessica]|[]|Foreign Affairs|2000|79|6|115|10.2307/20049971|pub.1102762906|58"

It defines why we exist and focuses our effort and resources to meet the Nation's security and military strategies. Fully nested under the United States Air Force's Strategic Plan, this strategy outlines the Combat Air Force (CAF) critical contributions to protecting democracy and guarding freedom. This plan is a broad conceptual document backed by detailed supporting concepts and plans designed to enable the CAF to adapt and overcome the challenges created by a rapidly changing security environment. The strategy builds upon the CAF's foundation and heritage as the world's dominant combat air force. CAF leadership in innovation and integration, combined with the asymmetric advantage its forces provide to our Nation, ensures success for the joint force. From the ultimate backstop of our Nation's defense - nuclear deterrence - to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, the long war on terror and across the full spectrum of conflict - the CAF defends our Nation now and in the future. The 21st-century CAF is an innovative, organizational construct that will develop, plan and employ integrated, coercive combat capabilities - from air, space and cyberspace - to create war-winning effects for our Nation. 'Securing the High Ground' provides the CAF its mission and vision while focusing the development, sustainment and execution of the preeminent combat airpower of America's joint force. It provides guidance to all CAF Airmen, from those just entering service to those in the upper levels of command, from active duty, reservists and guardsmen, to our dedicated civilian workforce. The strategy, priorities and objectives described herein set the stage for follow-on development of a more detailed collection of operational concepts and planning documents that will integrate all CAF capabilities and ensure the realization of our vision.",,2008,,,,"Corley, John D; Kehler, C R; Chandler, Carrol H; Brady, Roger A; Wurster, Donald C; McKinley, Craig R; Stenner, Charles E; Lord, William T",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091514736,0,

It suggests that due to the ascendance of Taiwan as the central security challenge for China and its inability to use conventional deterrence to prevent American military intervention in the Taiwan Strait, there are increasing Chinese discussions on the role of nuclear deterrence in this context. This article suggests that for political and strategic reasons China is unlikely to formally renounce the no-first-use policy. However, this does not rule out the possibility of China threatening first use of nuclear weapons when a real crisis in the strait makes American military intervention inevitable or imminent. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that some of China's nuclear experts are promoting a flexible approach to the no-first-use Policy. Thus, the article suggests the U.S. must prepare for the contingency of Chinese nuclear deterrence in the Taiwan Strait and examine how this scenario may impact American security strategies in the Pacific.",Comparative Strategy,2008,27,2,164-182,"Zhang, Baohui",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028401742,2,

In an effort to maintain its relevance, the U.S. Navy has embarked on a new course via the recently published ""Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower."" The development of the new strategy relied heavily on the opinions of sources outside the usual sea service cultural boundaries. The outcome was a strategy that placed the soft power of ""global cooperation"" on par with the vaunted hard power naval pillars of Power Projection and Nuclear Deterrence. The new strategy still includes hard power requirements, but the inclusion of soft power and its rise from a ""merely nice thing to do if possible"" to a strategic tool make the new maritime strategy quite unique from the past.

It argues that a key to understanding these developments is acceptance of pluralism—of theories, of political systems, of cultures, of methods of analysis, and of academic disciplines. Pluralism in at least some of these senses is a recognized strength of International Relations studies in the UK. The long tradition of acceptance of a plural international system, and a plural approach to understanding it, includes figures as varied as John Stuart Mill, Maxim Litvinoff, Alastair Buchan and Hedley Bull. The end of the Cold War was the result of a plural mix of factors: both force and diplomacy; both pressure and détente; both belief and disbelief in the reformability of communism; both civil resistance in some countries and guerrilla resistance in others; both elite action and street politics; both nuclear deterrence and the ideas of some of its critics; both threat and reassurance; both nationalism in the disparate parts of the Soviet empire and supranationalism in the European Community. Paradoxically, the specialists in politics and International Relations who came closest to foreseeing the end of the Cold War were those who made few if any claims to a ‘scientific’ approach, and whose idea of forecasting was based, at the very most, on Mill's modest concept of ‘a certain order of possible progress’. Since the end of the Cold War, simplistic interpretations of how it ended have contributed to narrow understandings of international order. The spirit of imposed universalism having fed from Moscow, has flourished as never before in its other favourite haunt, Washington DC. There is a need to recognize the plurality of perspectives that endure in the post-Cold War world.",International Affairs,2008,84,2,335-350,"ROBERTS, ADAM",University of Oxford,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034883453,6,"[Lewis, John Wilson; Di, Hua]|[; ]|International Security|1992|17|2|5|10.2307/2539167|pub.1069980738|44"

During the 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy developed a ""Stockpile Stewardship Program"" to certify the safety and reliability of that arsenal in the absence of explosive testing. This program has subsequently been challenged for its vast scale and expense, for its actual utility, and for its potential to facilitate the development of ""new"" nuclear weapons. This essay critiques ""stewardship"" as a contested historical and cultural discourse. It argues that, by appropriating this discourse, nuclear officials have rhetorically cast themselves as guardians of nuclear resources for the benefit of current and future generations, and have successfully defended themselves against undesirable change arising from public reconsideration of nuclear deterrence.

A propensity for acquiring a credible nuclear deterrence as a security guarantee against any potential threat from adverse or hostile neighbours, political and military elites in volatile regions such as South Asia, Middle East, and Northeast Asia are perpetually indulged in producing artificially insecurity syndrome among their people to legitimize the imperative of nuclear weapon building programme. Inter-Asian regional nuclear collaboration, for instance, between North Korea and Pakistan, between North Korea and Myanmar, between Iran and Pakistan, between Pakistan and China are alarming signs of fomenting the nuclear armament and missile race in Asia. Alexei Arbatov, Director of the Centre of International Security, Institute of the World Economy and International Relations, Russian Academy of Sciences; writes that with the ceasing of ideological and geopolitical rivalry between the two superpowers, nuclear proliferation has gained momentum in the horizontal proliferation in countries of volatile regions of Asia – India, Pakistan, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya – with the flawed support systems of the NPT, IAEA, and Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). For instance, NPT does not offer any tangible benefits to those countries renouncing acquisition of nuclear weapons, nor does it “envision serious punishment for military nuclear activities” ( Arbatov, 2004 ).","Contributions to Conflict Management, Peace Economics and Development",2008,Volume 5,Issue ccmped/2008/s1572-8323(2008)5/s1572-8323(2008)5/production,87-101,"Jain, B.M.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004872718,0,"[Cirincione, Joseph]|[]|SAIS Review of International Affairs|2005|25|2|157-165|10.1353/sais.2005.0031|pub.1019711623|2"
pub.1005050302,10.4324/9780203934784,China-US Relations Transformed,"China’s emergence in the 21st century to the status of great power has significant implications for its relationship with the United States, the sole superpower in the post-Cold War World. Now that China is rising as an economic, political, and military power and has expanded its diplomatic activism beyond Asia into Europe, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, its rise has profoundly transformed its relationship with the US and compelled leaders in both countries to redefine their positions toward each other. This book, written by leading scholars and policy analysts from both the US and China, explores the transformation and multifaceted nature of US-China relations, including how the political elite in both countries have defined their strategic objectives in response to China’s rise and managed their relations accordingly. It provides an up-to-date analysis on the policy adjustments of the last decade, and covers all the important issue areas such as security, nuclear deterrence, military modernization, energy, trade and economic interaction, and Asia-Pacific power reconfiguration. It does not seek to confirm either an alarmist or optimistic position but presents different views and assessments by foreign policy specialists with the hope that leaders in Washington and Beijing may make positive adjustments in their policies to avoid confrontation and war. It will also be an invaluable resource for students and scholars of US and Chinese politics, international relations and comparative politics.",,2007,,,,"Zhao, Suisheng",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005050302,1,

Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons is likely to transform the Middle East's strategic balance, force changes in Israel's national security planning in general and its nuclear policy in particular. This article analyses the options open to Israel in response to a nuclear Iran, and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Evaluation of the options available to Israel reveals seven alternatives. In the near future, Israeli decision makers will have to decide whether to adopt one or a mix of options ranging from preemptive attack to unconcealed nuclear deterrence. After analysing each of these options, the conclusion is that Israel probably will move to unconcealed nuclear deterrence in the event of Iran completing the development and the acquisition of nuclear weapons.",Contemporary Security Policy,2007,28,3,513-541,"Pedatzur, Reuven",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047479218,3,

Recent literature on terrorism and so-called “rogue” proliferation states is vast, and James Lebovic's book stands out among the very finest for its original arguments, richly documented presentation, and engaging and thought-provoking discussion. Overall, it is critical of the post-9/11 view dominant in U.S. strategic thinking that the main adversaries are undeterrable. It shows that terrorists and leaders of renegade regimes are neither mindless nor irrational, but rather are often sensitive to the costs of punishment and thus susceptible to the logic of deterrence. Deterrence doctrines should therefore not be abandoned as Cold War relics, and the book makes a remarkable contribution toward bridging the doctrinal issues and debates from the Cold War (nuclear deterrence) past to the current problems of antiproliferation and counterterrorism.",Perspectives on Politics,2007,5,4,869-870,"Danilovic, Vesna","University at Buffalo, State University of New York",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008315870,0,

As a result of advances in evolutionary psychology, we now know that how the brain interprets actions and makes decisions is complicated, imperfect, greatly dependent upon emotions, and varied among humans. Consequently, it is fundamentally naïve and dangerous to assume a similar outcome in deterrent situations when there is variation in cognition among leaders.

Just as the warden in the central tower watches the prisoners without their being able to see him, satellites watch the Earth while observed countries cannot escape or monitor the extent of the observation. Will observed countries factor in the control exerted by observing countries, just as prisoners will eventually interiorize the warden's discipline? This may indeed have been the goal of the U.S. satellite observation policy during the Cold War (1950's–1980's). The U.S. at the time sought to exert a new form of power on the international scene, resorting to persuasion and deterrence rather than all-out aggression. U.S. satellite surveillance was at work vis-a-vis the USSR through different policies linked to nuclear deterrence; and vis-a-vis U.S. Allies (NATO, Great-Britain, France and Israel), then subject to a U.S. information monopoly. The intended panoptical power was not totally efficient, however. Regarding the USSR, its exercise depended ultimately on the political climate between the two Superpowers.

However, Walker's ‘enlightenment’ and ‘counter-enlightenment’ tropes are clumsy and unsatisfactory tools for analysing contemporary policies concerning nuclear deterrence, non-proliferation and disarmament. Walker holds that in the 1960s and 1970s most of the governments of the world came together in pursuit of ‘a grand enlightenment project’. This thesis cannot withstand empirical scrutiny with regard to its three main themes—a supposed US-Soviet consensus on doctrines of stabilizing nuclear deterrence through mutual vulnerability, a notion that the NPT derived from ‘concerted efforts to construct an international nuclear order meriting that title’, and the view that the NPT embodied a commitment to achieve nuclear disarmament. Walker's criticisms of US nuclear policies since the late 1990s are in several cases overstated or ill-founded. Walker also exaggerates the potential influence of the United States over the policies of other countries. It is partly for this reason that the challenges at hand—both analytical and practical—are more complicated and dif cult than his article implies.

This essay begins with the question of legality of the nuclear weapons themselves. Here the advisory opinion of ICJ of 1996 provides a good reference. Secondly, this essay addresses the question whether or not North Korea is entitled to nuclear weapons even if the weapons are not illegal per se. Here the validity of the North Korea’s withdrawal from NPT matters. Even though North Korea’s withdrawal from NPT is valid, North Korea’s nuclear weapons would be blamed as threat to peace on the Chapter 7 of UN Charter. Last but not least, the nuclear deterrence is to be considered. There are various theses that legitimizes the deterrence policy in the realm of both international relations theory and the just war theory. North Korea’s deterrence policy could win approval of the realists like Kenneth Waltz, but would fail to satisfy the requirements of the just war theory.",Democratic Legal Studies,2007,null,33,229-262,정태욱,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050809609,0,
pub.1043932523,10.1080/05679320701266356,Nuclear Deterrence,"In December 2003 the British government announced that within a few years it would need to take decisions about the future of Britain's strategic nuclear deterrent. Exactly three years later, its plans were revealed in a White Paper. The existing Trident system is to be given a life extension, which includes building new submarines to carry the missiles, costing £15–20 billion. Britain has a substantial nuclear legacy, having owned nuclear weapons for over half a century. The strategic context for the deterrent has changed completely with the end of the Cold War, but nuclear weapons retain much of their salience. This Adelphi Paper argues that it makes sense to remain a nuclear power in an uncertain and nuclear-armed world. Given that deterrence needs are now less acute, but more complex than in the past, the paper asserts that deterrence also needs to be aligned with non-proliferation policies, which seek to reduce the scale of threats that need to be deterred. Somewhat overlooked in current policy are appropriate measures of defence, which can raise the nuclear threshold and, if required, mitigate the effects of deterrence failure. It concludes that the government's decisions about the future form of the deterrent are very sensible, but cautions that they still need to be integrated into a broader policy that embraces diplomacy, deterrence and defence to counter the risks posed by nuclear proliferation.",The Adelphi Papers,2007,46,386,43-60,"Stocker, Jeremy",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043932523,0,

The conditional deterrence model presented is applied to global and regional interactions driven by nuclear proliferation, and is further extended to anticipate challenges that may be generated by the acquisition of nuclear capabilities by terrorists. The key elements of our assessment include relative capabilities, risk propensity associated with the relative assessment of the status quo, and physical exposure to attack or retaliation. After reviewing previous efforts, we generalize insights to all deterrence environments. Our deductive findings indicate that deterrence is stable when the capabilities of a dissatisfied challenger are inferior to that of a dominant and satisfied defender. Deterrence is tenuous when a dissatisfied challenger approaches parity in capability with the dominant and satisfied defender, or when a violent non-state actor obtains nuclear or radiological weapons.",SSRN Electronic Journal,2007,,,,"Kang, Kyungkook; Kugler, Jacek",University of Central Florida; Claremont Graduate University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1102241025,0,

The Continuing Vitality of Russian-US Strategic Nuclear Deterrence,"The stability of nuclear deterrence between the United States and Russia no longer can be regarded as a relic of the Cold War. The topic is rapidly re-emerging as one of ever-greater relevance and policy-strategic urgency. A more fluid international order, the complexity of post-Cold War security issues, and the pressure of incipient nuclear proliferation in Asia, make clarity in American-Russian nuclear arms control of first importance. Through the revival of proven analytical techniques, however, this article self-consciously reintroduces concepts long at the heart of strategic nuclear debates. These show that although there is no imminent risk to first strike stability, arms control stability is more nuanced and cannot be assumed without deliberate effort. Missile defences, already deployed by the US and possibly appealing to others, may further complicate the stabilisation of Russian-American nuclear security relations and the containment of nuclear arms races in Asia. Strategic stability is not as important as before for immediate human survival, nor does it raise a significant danger of Russian-American confrontation, and certainly not a risk of pre-emptive attack.

While France remains determined to deter major power threats, its main new preoccupation is deterring regional powers by making clear that it has developed more employable nuclear options. The innovations announced in January 2006 include the focus on deterring state sponsors of terrorism, the threat to attach an enemy's ‘capacity to act’, the more discriminate and controllable employment options, the willingness to launch ‘final warning’ strikes, the description of ‘strategic supplies’ as a potential vital interest, and the presentation of nuclear deterrence as the foundation of a strategy of prevention and, when necessary, conventional military intervention. Several factors may have led Chirac to make the speech at this juncture. These include maintaining the credibility of deterrence and presidential power, sustaining the budgetary effort required for the nuclear posture, clarifying French deterrence doctrine for external and internal audiences, and sending a message of autonomy to Iran's and France's key European partners. The new doctrine's implications include its significance for deterrence and non-proliferation and for France's relations with its partners in NATO and the European Union.",International Affairs,2006,82,4,701-721,"YOST, DAVID S.",Naval Postgraduate School,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013731656,9,

This led to a disagreement with the United States. Today, the ban on nuclear-powered ships is the only element of the nuclear-free legislation that still strains US-New Zealand relations. This article presents the reasons for the ban on nuclear-powered ships, which include scientific safety concerns, a symbolic rejection of the nuclear deterrence posture, and patriotic factors such as a nuclear-free national identity. The military and economic consequences of the ban are also examined.

Anticipatory wars, but especially preventive war, are ‘hard cases’ for traditional Just War theory; other puzzles for this tradition include nuclear deterrence, humanitarian intervention, and provability a priori of the success of Tit-for-Tat. First, and despite strong assertions to the contrary, it is far from clear that preventive war is absolutely prohibited in traditional Just War Theory, and it is also dubious that it is in all cases ‘clearly illegal’. Second, the morality of both preemptive and preventive wars is shown to turn on epistemological considerations: on what degree and kind of justification the primary metaphysical facts of threat can be reasonably believed. Third, an argument is made that whatever epistemic threshold is held to be necessary, some preventive wars will exceed it, and that this is more likely with advancing technologies of information acquisition. Finally, the common argument that allowing all nations to follow policies of preventive war would result in more wars than barring such policies is shown to be mistaken by simulations in game theory.

In the 1940s and 1950s, scientific activities were profoundly redefined. A culture of laboratory solutions, of calculus, and management won the day. For the scientists, that meant versatility and a willingness to work between disciplines and métiers and to confront the nation's main concerns. It also led to increasingly technocratic versions of politics. Due to science, the state became a managerial apparatus, a ""modernizer"" arbitrating among different scenarios. Contrary to what happened in the United States, science was not center stage in France in the 1940s and early 1950s. The habitus of scientists was that of the prewar period, and they were still not technique-oriented. They had a more cultural definition of their trade and were not opportunists whose aim was to become pragmatically efficient in the world of business and military action. From the mid-1950s, things started to evolve due to a strong economic recovery and because French scientists had now caught up with the latest developments. The final break, however, occurred in France only when de Gaulle abandoned the Algerian war and elected for an autonomous nuclear deterrence system.

None of these explanations, however, can be supported by closer analysis. There was a “war scare” around 1980, but it has now passed; no upsurge of pacifism ever existed; and anti-Americanism is present, but in no significantly greater degree than the postwar norm. The problem is both more specific and more general—a new loss of confidence in the current political leadership of the United States combined with a long-standing popular reluctance to rely as confidently as do their governments on nuclear deterrence.

This paper explores the possibility of economic cooperation—including both trade and common infrastructure projects—taking place and spilling over into security cooperation. It analyses why past economic cooperation was so minimal, and why the only major agreement, that on the Indus basin waters, did not lead to deeper economic or security cooperation. Viewing the India–Pakistan relationship through the concepts of cumulative relative gains sensitivity, trade expectations and common projects, drawn from recent international relations theory literature, the paper argues that economic cooperation between the two depends on either prior security cooperation or, as a substitute, de facto deterrence. Nuclear deterrence now being a reality, the paper argues that, contrary to what may appear to be the case on the surface, the cumulative relative gains sensitivity of both sides, especially Pakistan, can now be reduced to enable economic cooperation that has the potential to create positive security spillovers.",Contemporary South Asia,2005,14,3,321-339,"Sridharan, E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016597148,6,

Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 2004. 512p. $40.00. This new work on the core issue of nuclear proliferation is somewhat unique in its focus and organization. Most of the works on this subject have a virtually standard organization involving a country-by-country breakdown of the most recent and most likely proliferators (India, Pakistan, Israel, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, etc.), according to their motives (why they want to go nuclear) and their capacity to do so, either by themselves or with the help of existing nuclear powers. The focus of these works is, therefore, on what often is called “horizontal proliferation,” having to do with the addition of extra members to the “nuclear club.” Regarding the Cold War superpowers, the United States and former USSR, there has been a largely separate literature devoted to “vertical proliferation,” and associated arms control measures and possibilities, in the context of nuclear deterrence theories and concepts. The uniqueness of Nathan Busch's book is that he combines these two genres, treating various aspects of the nuclear programs of the long-existent large nuclear powers, as well as the emerging nuclear programs of Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and so on as an integrated subject.",Perspectives on Politics,2005,3,3,682-683,"Harkavy, Robert E.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014596399,0,

This work argues that while a clear enunciation of its nuclear doctrine and command structure will enhance regional stability and assure the international community, it is at the operational level that India continues to, and will have to work harder to, achieve its nuclear policy goals. Nations base their nuclear doctrines and command structures on the assumptions of traditional nuclear deterrence theory. However, as this paper demonstrates, at the operational level, the simple coherence and elegance of nuclear deterrence theory begins to break down. This is the challenge that India faces as it tries to evolve into a “nuclear weapon state.”",Comparative Strategy,2005,24,3,277-293,"Pant, Harsh V.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049620993,6,

Before Israel's nuclear arsenal can purposefully enhance that country's security, it will first have to contribute recognizably to Israeli nuclear deterrence and to Israel's perceived ability to undertake certain vital preemptions. With these points in mind, this article seeks to draw certain timely strategic lessons for Israel from the hero of the post-Pentateuchal Book, JUDGES. Looking to Samson, Israel can learn new ways to enhance its nuclear deterrence, preemption and warfighting options. Here, Scripture can inform strategy-and in surprisingly imaginative and generally unanticipated ways. The article explicitly identifies six important lessons from Samson: (1) Perceived willingness to take some existential risks can strengthen Israel's deterrence, preemption and warfighting postures; (2) Israel, like Samson, possesses great strength, but that strength can be blunted if it is not properly understood and exploited; (3) Israel must soon understand from Samson that all things move in the midst of death, and that such an understanding is altogether critical to defeating its Arab/Islamic enemies; (4) Israel can benefit from Samson's very concrete and palpable sense of catastrophe; from learning that its physical survival is never assured; (5) Samson can teach Israel that there is great and mortal danger in wishful thinking; and (6) Along similar lines, Israel can learn from Samson that self-delusion is a threat on several different levels, including the nurturance of erroneous presumptions about the stability of the state system itself-a decentralized system of world politics that came into being in 1648, after the Thirty Years' War and the Peace of Westphalia.",Israel Affairs,2005,11,3,491-503,"BERES, LOUIS RENE",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039705081,1,

European fleets were tasked with containing a Soviet attack until US forces could arrive on the scene. Many European navies pursued essential niche capabilities tailored for their own unique maritime environments. Others made important contributions to broader NATO efforts in the high-stakes arenas of sea control, power projection and even nuclear deterrence. Contentious issues did arise, for example concerning burden-sharing, but true to its name, the alliance succeeded collectively in wielding formidable sea power. This paper is based on the premise that the maritime players in the Cold War at sea were by no means restricted to the US and Soviet navies. The navies of Western Europe and Canada had major roles to play as well within the NATO area. They contributed a great deal to the political cohesion crucial to an essentially maritime alliance, and in many cases had a real operational contribution to make as well.

Evidence from the 1990 Case,"Scholars have claimed that nuclear weapons help to stabilize South Asia by preventing Indo-Pakistani militarized crises from escalating to the level of all-out conventional war. This article argues that while nuclear weapons have had cautionary effects on Indian and Pakistani decision makers, proliferation also has played a role in fomenting some of the very crises that scholars credit nuclear weapons with defusing. Moreover, nuclear deterrence was not always essential to preventing these crises from escalating to the level of outright war. The article illustrates its argument with evidence from the Indo-Pakistani militarized crisis of 1990.Leading scholars and analysts have argued that nuclear weapons help to prevent South Asian militarized crises from escalating to the level of all-out conventional war. 1 1.

View all notes This claim has important implications for the regional security environment and beyond. Given the volatile nature of Indo-Pakistani relations, reducing the likelihood of crisis escalation would make the subcontinent significantly safer. The claim also suggests that nuclear weapons could lower the probability of war in crisis-prone conflict dyads elsewhere in the world.This article takes a less sanguine view of nuclear weapons’ impact on South Asian militarized crises. It argues that while nuclear weapons have at times had important cautionary effects on Indian and Pakistani decision makers, proliferation has played a role in fomenting a number of the very crises that scholars credit nuclear weapons with defusing. Moreover, it is not clear that nuclear deterrence was essential to preventing some of these crises from escalating to the level of outright war. I illustrate my argument with evidence from the period when India and Pakistan were acquiring nascent nuclear weapons capabilities. I show that during the late 1980s, Pakistan’s emerging nuclear capacity emboldened Pakistani decision makers to provide extensive support to the emerging insurgency against Indian rule in Jammu and Kashmir. In early 1990, India responded with large-scale force deployments along the Line of Control and International Border, in an attempt to stem militant infiltration into Indian territory, and potentially to intimidate Pakistan into abandoning its Kashmir policy. Pakistan countered with large deployments of its own, and the result was a major Indo-Pakistani militarized standoff. Although scholars have credited Pakistani nuclear weapons with deterring India from attacking Pakistan during this crisis, the preponderance of available evidence suggests that Indian leaders never seriously considered striking Pakistan, and therefore were not in fact deterred from launching a war in 1990. Thus nuclear weapons played an important role in fomenting a major Indo-Pakistani crisis during this period, but probably were not instrumental in preventing the crisis from escalating to the level of outright war.Below, I briefly describe the emergence of the Kashmir insurgency. I then explain how Pakistan’s nuclear capacity encouraged it to support the uprising. Next, I show how conflict between Pakistan-supported guerillas and Indian security forces in Kashmir drove a spiral of tension between the two countries, which led to a stand-off between Indian and Pakistani armed forces in early 1990. Finally, I discuss the end of the 1990 crisis, and address the role that nuclear weapons played in its peaceful deescalation.",Asian Security,2005,1,2,174-189,"Kapur, Paul S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001636660,0,

The nuclear weapon states have traditionally resisted granting such unconditional NSAs. Recent U.S. efforts to use nuclear deterrence against the acquisition and use by other states of chemical, biological and radiological weapons, however, have further exacerbated this divide. This article analyzes the historical development of NSAs and contrasts U.S. commitments not to use nuclear weapons with the empirical realities of current U.S. nuclear weapons employment doctrines. The authors conclude that NSAs are most likely to be issued as unilateral declarations and that such pledges are the worst possible manner in which to handle the issue of security assurance.",The Nonproliferation Review,2005,12,1,37-70,"Blair, Charles P.; du preez, Jean P.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014811484,1,

Two explanatory models were compared: perceptions of risk and normative beliefs. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to 1,396 students at a large Midwestern university. Data analyses were conducted on the subsample of participants who had reported using alcohol within the past 12 months (n = 1,322). Overall, the results from a canonical correlation analysis indicated that alcohol involvement was best explained by normative beliefs about the drinking practices of one’s closest friends. Perceptions of drinking risk were less important to the explanation of alcohol involvement, and some of these measures unexpectedly had positive associations with indicators of alcohol risk behavior. The findings call into question the conventional deterrence strategies used in many university communities (i.e., belief that students who perceive there to be a low risk of receiving sanctions are those most likely to engage in alcohol related misbehavior).

Until very recently, nuclear deterrence formed the foundation of U.S. national security strategy. Nuclear weapons were expected to deter strikes not only on the American homeland but also on allies in Europe and Asia. Within the growing community of nuclear abolitionists, the end of the Cold War and the nuclear equilibrium that defined it represented a rare turning point in the longstanding quest to eliminate nuclear weapons globally.

Hitherto ANZAM had focused almost completely upon planning for the wartime defence of sea communications in the Southwest Pacific. This article explains why the UK sought to revitalise ANZAM, and why Australia accepted the British proposal. The British proposal arose from the adoption by the UK of a strategy of nuclear deterrence which led it to project both a future reduction of British conventional forces available for overseas commitments, and a greater reliance upon Commonwealth partners for the protection of British interests in Malaya. It also represented an attempt to reduce the value of the ANZUS security treaty, signed in early September 1951. Australia accepted the British proposal that Commonwealth partners should shoulder a heavier burden in Malaya as a way of preserving the value of ANZUS and of adjusting to the future reduction of the British military presence in Asia.",Australian Journal of Politics & History,2004,50,4,509-525,"Umetsu, Hiroyuki",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052491451,4,"[Brands, Henry W.]|[]|The International History Review|1987|9|2|250-270|10.1080/07075332.1987.9640442|pub.1027842496|7;[Lee, David]|[ur.012134146321.63]|War & Society|1995|13|1|61-80|10.1179/072924795791200178|pub.1028135598|3;[Baylis, John; Macmillan, Alan]|[; ]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1993|16|2|200-226|10.1080/01402399308437514|pub.1028279270|10;[Williams, John]|[]|Review of International Studies|1987|13|4|243-263|10.1017/s0260210500113506|pub.1054013449|5"

While harvesting economic returns and prestige through negotiations, the nation has muddled through to the point that it can show the “plutonium bombs-in-the-basement” any time and produce highly enriched uranium soon. The North's call for “inter-Korean brotherly collaboration” delicately combined with nuclear blackmail has divided South Korean society and estranged the ROK-U.S. alliance. However, the game has entered a sudden-death playoff as the North's internal paradoxes as well as the international pressure will not tolerate it any longer. Soon Pyongyang will have to make a strategic choice among Pakistani, Israeli, Libyan, and Ukrainian models.

Deterrence itself, for all its criminality, falls or may fall for the moment under the standard of necessity. But as with terror bombing, so here with the threat of terrorism: supreme emergency is never a stable position. The realm of necessity is subject to historical change. And, what is more important, we are under an obligation to seize upon opportunities of escape, even to take risks for the sake of such opportunities. It is my purpose to side with the Michael Walzer who urges taking risks to bring about historical change in what is necessary and against the Michael Walzer who settles for coping, however reluctantly, with a supposedly permanent supreme emergency that is claimed to excuse the criminality of threats of mass destruction with nuclear weapons. In the process I hope to demonstrate the failure of one of the most comprehensive attempts to justify nuclear deterrence – and thus a reliance on the most highly developed weapons of mass destruction – in a manner consistent with liberalism.",Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction,2004,,,139-162,"Shue, Henry",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051597526,3,

Like other political leaders, Buddhist rulers traditionally used physical force to protect their countries. Although governments with large Buddhist populations (such as Japan, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Mongolia, and Thailand) reject the use of weapons of mass destruction, and the Tibetan government-in-exile has advocated a nuclear-free zone, Buddhist organizations in France, England, and the United States have largely acquiesced in national policies of nuclear deterrence. While this chapter acknowledges that the acceptance of WMD as a deterrent by some Buddhists during the cold war was not an anomaly in Buddhist history, the main point to emphasize is that neither practical arguments nor Buddhist principles can support the deployment of WMD today, and they should be rejected based on the ultimate Buddhist goals of nonviolence and the protection of all living beings. Most Buddhists do not advocate the use of violence except as a last resort, if at all, and the thrust of lay Buddhist ethics is toward pacifism. Although I argue here that, in the light of modern history and Buddhist political experience, the deployment WMD might have been justified during the cold war, this policy should have been supported by efforts to build greater cross-cultural awareness, economic fairness, and political inclusiveness in the global community.",Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction,2004,,,213-236,"Chappell, David W.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005211454,0,

Three central reasons are discussed in this essay: the limitations and the dilemma of power; the proposition that the most threatening form of terrorism, such as al-Qaeda's, is conducted by nonstate actors, conventional deterrence against whom is less effective; and the role of motivation in conflicts where the distribution of power is asymmetrical.

Such activity, without pronounced intent, is invoking terror for the sake of terror. America has declared the Bush Doctrine for the unilateral use of armed force, war, to preempt the use of this WMD capability - offense being the best form of defense - following a failure of nuclear deterrence and of local defenses. This transformation of American foreign policy is the first disarmament case study of its kind for unilateral war as a continuation of arms control policy differing from the bipolar international agreements of the Cold War. The article further projects the need for a 'Global Convention on Proliferation' to provoke the community of nations to a multipolar approach of self-regulatory arms control and disarmament. The strength and viability of such a global convention will rest on the hegemonic power's willingness and ability to pursue unilateral preemptive armed force against rogue states. This will function as a new deterrent - in the long term negating the need for further preemptive wars.",The Review of International Affairs,2004,3,3,479-494,"Segell, Glen",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002262135,1,

In the post-World War II period, Australia, with renewed emphasis on its emotional attachment to the mother country and with strong determination to sustain the capacity of the UK to maintain its position as a global power, embarked upon taking a larger share of the defense burden in the British Commonwealth orbit. In 1955, one culmination of Australia's endeavors to prevent the contraction of the sphere of British Commonwealth influence in the world, particularly Asia, came when the Australian Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, announced in early April that Australia would become an active partner of Britain and New Zealand in defending Malaya, and that Australian ground forces, together with more air and naval forces, would shortly be stationed in Malaya as part of a Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. The establishment of a Strategic Reserve signified that the defense of the Malaya archipelago was placed under a joint responsibility of the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and that the primary planning responsibility for the external defense of Malaya was transferred to Australia from Britain. The creation of a Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaya originated at the end of 1952, when the British government made a proposal for the reactivation of the ANZAM arrangement and for focusing the arrangement more firmly upon the defense of British interests in Malaya, and was based on an agreement reached in October 1953 between British, Australian and New Zealand Chiefs of Staff. This article examines why the UK government broached a proposal for the reactivation of ANZAM and for the creation of a Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaya, and why Australia accepted the British proposal. This article argues the British proposal for the reactivation of ANZAM arose from a change in its strategic doctrine. The adoption by the UK government of the strategy of nuclear deterrence led the government to project the future reduction of its conventional forces available for overseas commitments and the consequent more reliance upon Commonwealth partners for the protection of British interests in Malaya. At the same time, the UK proposal for a reactivated ANZAM represented an attempt by the British government to reduce the value of the ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand and the United States) security treaty signed in early September 1951. It is also argued that Australia accepted the British proposal for having Commonwealth partners shoulder a heavier cold war burden in Malaya as a way of adjusting itself to the future diminution of the British military presence in Asia. As well, the Australian agreement to the British proposal for involving ANZAM more deeply in the defense of Malaya represented an attempt by the Pacific dominion to block Britain's further pressure for association with ANZUS and to preserve the vitality of the security treaty with the Americans.",International Relations,2004,2004,136,"97-116,l11","UMETSU, Hiroyuki",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115142872,0,

After the fall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the former Soviet Union, there was much optimism and hope in the West. The end of the Cold War decreased radically the risk of nuclear war in Europe and in the other parts of the world. At the time, many believed that the main global, political and ideological confrontation had been eliminated erasing the very raison d’être for nuclear deterrence. The need for nuclear weapons, at least with regard to the most important and dangerous East-West axis of world politics, had been removed. In addition, globalization was engaging nations in an interconnected economy and integrated society, providing the conditions considered necessary for international stability. The prospect of a less conflicted and more peaceful world caused many to believe that the role of nuclear weapons would decrease as tensions relaxed and stability restored.","Contributions to Conflict Management, Peace Economics and Development",2004,Volume 1,Issue ccmped/2005/s1572-8323(2005)1/s1572-8323(2005)1/production,111-121,"Fedorov, Yuri E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015741674,0,

Case studies of this crisis and its predecessors in 1954-55 and 1958 demonstrate that US military deterrence was not a decisive factor in their resolution. US and PRC initiatives and responses in the 1950s crises introduced the essential elements of 'strategic ambiguity' into the triangular relationship between themselves and Taiwan.

In examining the arguments presented by members of Congress, academicians, the media, religious leaders, and international observers, this article illustrates how the US government and the presidential administration of Ronald Reagan created the USIP as a reluctant concession to forces with a more genuine interest in peace. An overview of the historical initiatives to create a government-sponsored institute for peace establishes that the campaign is as old as the nation itself. US forays into civil war, national aggrandizement, and world wars derailed 19th- and 20th-century progress on the creation of a peace department. The academy concept re-emerged after World War II, only to find new competition in the Cold War. This article also considers the 1981-83 legislative attempts toward a United States Peace Academy, the work of the resulting exploratory commission, and the ensuing hearings and debate. The testimony of witnesses before the Commission and during congressional hearings traversed a wide continuum, from support to derision for the Peace Academy. Would the academy symbolize a peace commitment to the world community, or suggest that the United States had gone soft, unwilling or unable to win the Cold War? Was the study of peace a cozy yet unviable liberal ideal, or was peace and conflict resolution studies a meritorious, `teachable' discipline? Did a Peace Academy represent a positive cost-benefit ratio with regard to US weapons expenditures, or were peace initiatives no substitute for military deterrence? While these debates ended with the 1984 creation of the USIP, the backlash of the Reagan administration plagued the institution's start-up and funding, and suggested that the administration would merely pay lip service to peace, while continuing to prepare for war.

pub.1091520196,10.21236/ada414501,Nuclear Deterrence is Here to Stay,"In the most recent National Security Strategy President Bush has stated that deterrence doesn't work. The latest Nuclear Posture Review, completed in December 2001, proposed the tenets of Nuclear Deterrence to be: downsize the nuclear force level to 1700 - 2200 weapons, develop smaller yield weapons, and preempt if necessary. Additionally, President Bush supports developing a national missile defense system to protect the U.S. homeland. In my paper, I will offer the thesis that nuclear deterrence has kept us from going to major war with a peer since the inception of nuclear weapons, and is still vital to our national security. Additionally, I will argue that a national missile defense system may enhance our security against rogue states, but can not replace nuclear weapons; that terrorist and non-state actors can be deterred through deterrence by denial; that we should develop smaller yield nuclear weapons (despite large infrastructure concerns), and that we should NOT reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal to that of a minor nuclear power.",,2003,,,,"Welsh, John J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091520196,0,

National security guidance, including a recent nuclear policy review, make clear the expected existence of ICBMs for the foreseeable future. At the same time, the relevance of ICBMs to the nation is not wholly clear. The numbers and types of nuclear arms continue to be negotiated away, and there is some academic discussion on the continued need for the traditional strategic force posture the nuclear triad. The Air Force is articulating requirements for a new land-based strategic nuclear deterrent as well as conducting studies for long-range strike capabilities. Also, the idea of projecting power with a conventional warhead on a ballistic missile at intercontinental ranges is prominent in some circles, offering a means to strike targets rapidly with minimal reaction times. Historically, though, the Air Force neglected the ICBM, and their development was slowed by the Air Force's focus on the manned strategic bomber. For the last three decades of the Cold War, ICBMs steadily supplanted bombers as the Air Force's main contribution to the national nuclear deterrence posture. However, this favoritism as well as a neglect of deterrence theory contributed to an Air Force indicted by Carl Builder for emphasizing the airplane over other means of delivering firepower. Overall, the Air Force needs familiarity with various issues associated with the ICBM, for with the right emphasis this cold war weapon system can stay viable throughout the coming century.",,2003,,,,"Pridotkas, Joseph J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091554449,0,
pub.1005252060,10.1017/cbo9780511510038.015,The Ghost of Vietnam,"The United States military has never been comfortable with irregular and unconventional warfare. Its defining moment was the conventional clash of arms in the Second World War, and during the Cold War, nuclear deterrence aside, it prepared itself for conventional war with the Soviets in Europe. Military planners envisaged a great clash of armor and tactical air in the Fulda Gap where Soviet forces were expected to attack into the North German Plain. In this optic, Vietnam was a distraction and an aberration. Yet Vietnam proved a traumatic experience for the U.S. military, particularly the army, and its shadow continues to hang over America's military as it enters the twenty-first century. The great lesson of Vietnam for the U.S. military was a refusal to ever again fight a limited war against irregular forces. After the Vietnam War the U.S. military increasingly came to develop a new way of war — what I call standoff precision strike warfare — which exploits high technology to produce rapid, decisive victory in conventional combat. The Gulf War was the most obvious example of this new way of war. Yet irregular forces and unconventional war will not go away. In the post—Cold War period, the U.S. military has been faced with increased demands for dealing with irregular warfare in the Balkans, Somalia, Haiti, and elsewhere. It has responded by trying to avoid another “quagmire.” There has been intense internal debate about how the U.S. military should respond to the demands of “peace operations.”",Irregular Armed Forces and their Role in Politics and State Formation,2003,,,346-384,"Roxborough, Ian",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005252060,1,

Many Pakistani defence analysts see both deterrence and security as synonymous. This paper analyses Pakistan's nuclear strategy in the context of first, its threat perception, second, its plan to achieve parity with India and third, its objective after the tests to portray Kashmir as a nuclear flashpoint to persuade the world community's indulgence and intervention to resolve the issue. Pakistan, like India, has maintained nuclear ambiguity and mentioned the deterrence value of its nuclear strategy. This paper also analyses Pakistan's nuclear diplomacy from the perspective of its security and discusses its nuclear doctrine, its nuclear strategy in the context of the Kargil conflict and the recent standoff with India to examine the extent to which it has been able to achieve its objectives of nuclear deterrence.

During the preceding period of superpower rivalry, debates over the credibility of nuclear deterrence attracted the attention of sophisticated game theorists in diverse disciplines. But with the end of the Cold War, this research tradition virtually ground to a halt. In this important new book, two long-term contributors to this body of research revisit these issues and effectively recast these models as representations of policy dilemmas of long-standing and continuing relevance. For instance, their models of U.S. strategic doctrines of massive retaliation and flexible response prove relevant to any situation in which the parties perceive two levels of conflict to be significantly different, even if neither level involves the use of nuclear weapons.",American Political Science Review,2002,96,3,695-696,"McGinnis, Michael D.",Indiana University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034574813,0,

Nuclear stability implies mutual confidence that the minimum conditions of rational deterrence models are fulfilled with high confidence. As US and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals are gradually reduced in conformity with the Moscow Treaty to levels far below current deployments, the qualities of forces and the performances of their command and control systems matter as much as do the exact quantities of weapons held by the two sides. Data analysis shows that both the US and Russia can expect to maintain a minimum counter‐city deterrent even at levels below the once proposed START III or agreed Moscow treaty limits, but defense deployments add uncertainty to projections and might compromise second strike retaliation under some conditions of launch readiness or warning.",The Journal of Slavic Military Studies,2002,15,3,1-24,"Cimbala, Stephen J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002354654,0,"[Mathers, Jennifer G.]|[ur.016525107267.36]||2000||||10.1057/9780230535763|pub.1042905002|3"

He was a true believer in the mission of the military and specifically in the efficacy of nuclear deterrence, but he was also a thinking man, and his doubts had begun in the 1970s. Finally, in 1988 during a visit to Moscow, he wrote, “it all came crashing home to me that I really had been dealing with a caricature all those years” (Smith 1997, 20). Butler was nearing the end of what he described as a “long and arduous intellectual journey from staunch advocate of nuclear deterrence to a public proponent of nuclear abolition” (Butler 1996). The difference between Butler and many others in the military was that “he reflected on what he was doing time and again,” and much of what he’d come to take for normal did not add up. He wrote, “We have yet to fully grasp the monstrous effects of these weapons . . . and the horrific prospect of a world seething with enmities, armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons.” To do so will require overcoming a “terror- induced anesthesia which suspend[s] rational thought” in order to see that “we cannot at once keep sacred the miracle of existence and hold sacrosanct the capacity to destroy it” (Butler 1998). Butler, now in private business, devotes a substantial part of his life to the abolition of nuclear weapons. Ray Anderson, founder and CEO of Interface Corporation, experienced an even more abrupt conversion. In 1994, after 21 years as the head of a highly successful carpet and tile company, he was asked by his senior staff to define the company’s environmental policy. “Frankly,” he writes, “I did not have a vision” (Anderson 1998, 39). In trying to develop one, he happened to read Paul Hawken’s (1993) The Ecology of Commerce, and the effect was, as he put it, like “a spear in the chest” (Anderson 1998, 23). He subsequently read other books ranging from Daniel Quinn’s Ishmael to Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring. The effect of his reading and reflection was to deepen and intensify an emotional and intellectual commitment to transform the company.",The Nature of Design,2002,,,,"Orr, David W.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132528307,0,

A complex multi-polar international structure replaced a much simpler bipolar structure that was dominated by a well-understood monolithic threat. The resultant uncertainty drives the U.S. to adjust its deterrence strategy to the changed strategic environment. The Bush Administration proposed a new strategic plan with significant adjustments to force structure and deterrence policy. I propose to assess the Bush Administration's plan for strategic nuclear deterrence in the Third Millennium. I will first examine the concept of deterrence strategy and then review the strategies used in the Cold War and post-Cold War eras. I will then assess the existing and emerging strategic threats. I will then review the emerging strategy of the Bush Administration and provide alternative strategies in comparison to the Bush Plan for U.S. strategic nuclear deterrence.",,2002,,,,"Durr, Charles W.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091575247,0,
pub.1054034720,10.1177/0022343302039002002,A Cognitive Theory of Deterrence,"Prospect theory is an empirical model of choice that stands as the leading alternative to rationality for explaining decisions under conditions of risk. While many still defend the assumption of rationality as an appropriate starting point for the construction of international relations theory - deterrence theory especially - there is growing support for models of international politics grounded in the actual capacities of real-world decisionmakers. This article accepts that standard depictions of deterrence incentives capture much of the essential character of deterrent relationships. However, it substitutes cognitive assumptions in place of traditional rational choice. Using prospect theory, the article reconsiders three typical deterrence games.

Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000. 356p. $49.50.","Clausewitz once observed that in war everything is simple, but the simplest things are very complicated. This seems to apply doubly so to nuclear deterrence. The principle is very simple: A potential enemy is persuaded not to do anything rash by the prospect of devastating retaliation. But it soon gets complicated. What difference does it make if the idea is not only to protect the homeland but also allies? As potential enemies acquire their own means of devastating retaliation, issues of preemption arise, and this requires close attention to the details of force structure. How varied, overwhelming, and surprising need the attacker be, especially if there is little interest in preemption? How much need the defender disperse, conceal, or protect forces, or develop antimissile defenses, just in case the other side is contemplating preemption? What happens if both sides are contemplating preemption at the same time? Can understandings, tacit or negotiated, between potential enemies ease the dangers of a crisis getting out of hand?",American Political Science Review,2002,96,1,262-263,"Freedman, Lawrence",King's College London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113384875,0,
pub.1091540638,10.21236/ada401016,Conventional Military Deterrence - Its Rise to Dominance and Its Future,"During the Cold War, military deterrence evolved into a mutually supportive, strategic nuclear and conventional approach. Conventional deterrence, though, was subordinate to nuclear deterrence. Operationally this framework of deterrence extended to U.S. allies and friends, and functioned with a focus on escalation and punishment. Beginning in the early 1990's as the Cold War environment dissipated, the requirement to reassess U.S. deterrence strategy became evident. Based on the changing security environment, conventional deterrence could no longer remain subordinate to or implicitly attached to nuclear deterrence. The purpose of this paper is to explore what factors gave rise in the years since the Cold War to a concept of conventional deterrence equal in standing to nuclear deterrence. These factors are also applied to current and potential trends to examine the future of conventional deterrence in U.S. strategy. Theoretical concepts of deterrence will serve as a foundation for discussion and analysis of the factors that have undergone fundamental changes since the Cold War. Overall, dynamics of the conventional and nuclear components of deterrence strategy must be balanced properly in response to the strategic environment in order to capitalize on the effectiveness of deterrence strategy.",,2002,,,,"Lichtenstein, Wendy L.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091540638,0,

Each of the eighteen Trident class submarines built to carry the mantle of strategic nuclear deterrence was extremely large and quiet with tubes for twenty-four ballistic missiles. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the United States conducted a review of its nuclear posture, which determined that only fourteen of these submarines were necessary to meet the needs of U.S. national security. Since these submarines are due for nuclear core refueling and overhaul and thus are no longer required to support U.S. nuclear policy, these submarines will be deactivated or refueled and converted to other purposes. These submarines are only halfway through their design life of forty-two years, and once refueled could be used for other missions. Furthermore, their large size makes these ships a prime candidate for conversion to a large variety of missions that require space, stealth, and endurance, This excess capability has convinced the U.S. Navy that it should develop a concept for converting the first four Trident class ballistic missile submarines into guided missile submarines (SSGN). This program would equip these submarines both for cruise missile operations and as special operations force insertion platforms. Each submarine could carry more than 100 Tomahawk cruise missiles and up to sixty-six special operations personnel with dual Dry Deck Shelter or two Advanced SEAL Delivery System mini-submarines for SEAL deployment.",,2002,,,,"Johnson, Edward A",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127419568,0,

The development of nuclear weapons and missiles, they contend, is required to deter foreign hostility and political coercion. This claim could be correct: Nuclear deterrence might foster peace and security in South Asia. But at what cost? Will Indian or Pakistan replicate the Soviet experience, whereby the costs of creating and maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent bankrupt the government and society? Are India and Pakistan threatening their future prosperity, prestige, and security for questionable security gains? This chapter identifies the costs of the nuclear deterrent programs pur- sued by India and Pakistan.

There had already existed a state of opaque or existential deterrence between India and its neighbors, China and Pakistan, and whether the 1998 nuclear tests make deterrence any more robust is questionable. Like the general concept of nuclear deterrence, India’ declared policy of minimum deterrence remains a chimera. However, UN Security Council Resolution 1172 passed in June 1998 is unprecedented insofar as it urges India and Pakistan to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a demand that cannot be supported by international law. If India’ decision to go nuclear may lack strategic, political and economic benefits, there are even more serious flaws underlying the NPT and CTBT that have not been addressed. The U. S. policy of aggressively pursuing its missile defense program further complicates this international state of affairs. It is unfortunate that India, which earlier opposed the global arms race, has now come out in support of the U.

The introduction of nuclear capable ballistic missiles on a significant scale adds to the negative variables that collectively raises the risk of an inadvertent nuclear war breaking out in a region that is unstable principally due to the Kashmir territorial dispute. The ongoing ballistic missile development signifies that the region is adopting a new and more precarious strategic dimension. India and Pakistan’s missile developments are arguably a greater threat to South Asia’s stability than the nuclear tests of 1998 that merely underlined they were nuclear powers. Despite signs of cooling relations between India and Pakistan highlighted by the Lahore Accord of February 1999, in practice very little has been achieved to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. Only two months after the much heralded Lahore Accord and bus diplomacy, the region witnessed the largest round of missile tests with India launching the 2,500 km Agni-II followed by Pakistan’s flight test of the 2,000-2,300 km-range Ghauri-II/Hatf-VI and the Shaheen-I/Hatf-IV (750 km) within days of each other.",Nuclear India in the Twenty-First Century,2002,,,189-209,"Sheppard, Ben",King's College London,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005645374,2,"[Ganguly, umit]|[]|International Security|1996|21|2|76-107|10.1162/isec.21.2.76|pub.1030046952|33;[Blight, James G.; Welch, David A.]|[; ]|Security Studies|1995|4|4|811-850|10.1080/09636419509347609|pub.1053360617|10;[Hagerty, Devin T.]|[ur.015325544015.21]|International Security|1995|20|3|79|10.2307/2539140|pub.1069980718|41"

The subsequent Indian doctrine of minimum credible deterrence, too, was based on few inputs from the end-users—the Indian armed forces. At present the Indian Air Force has the most developed infrastructure, equipment, and trained forces to provide a limited deterrent. However, the most versatile deterrent is in the form of nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic missiles. Not unexpectedly, the Indian Navy has staked such a claim. On the other hand, the largest and most powerful of the three defense services, the Indian Army, too, has sought a significant role in nuclear war fighting. Ultimately, an integrated higher defense organization will be required to manage the competing claims and provide a rational cost-effective system of minimum credible nuclear deterrence.

This is due a combination of interrelated political, economic and technical constraints.

This study is part of a continuing effort to use Strategic Personality Typing to gain insight into how to design more supple and effective deterrent strategies in the face of a potentially more diverse cast of nuclear players. It focuses on how small and medium nuclear powers might use nuclear weapons to try to deter U.S. military intervention in regional crises. The paper addresses not only deterring Iraq and Iran, but also preventing states like them from using nuclear weapons to deter the US from pursuing its global strategic interests. The study centers around two case studies based on plausible future scenarios, both set in the not-too-distant future but before deployment of a reliable and effective theater-wide ballistic missile defense system. Each case study begins with a brief survey of how the historical plots of Iraq and Iran shaped their Ultimate Concerns and Strategic Personalities. The study concludes with a discussion of how the differences in the Strategic Personalities of Iraq and Iran lead to different perceptions of their strategic interests, of how the United States threatens those interests, and how those differences shape the challenges for U.S. nuclear deterrence.",,2001,,,,"Ziemke, Caroline F.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091760416,1,

It evokes the entire gamut of emotions from good to evil, from hope to despair, and from the salvation of humanity to its utter destruction. No other element bears such a burden. Its discovery in 1941, following the discovery of fission in 1938, unlocked the potential and fear of the nuclear age. During the Cold War, the primary interest in plutonium was to provide triggers for thermonuclear weapons that formed the basis of nuclear deterrence. Beginning in the 1950s, plutonium also became an integral part of the quest for nearly limitless electrical power. The end of the Cold War has dramatically altered the military postures of the United States and Russia, allowing each to reverse the engines fueling the nuclearweapons buildup. Now, both countries face the challenge of keeping the remaining stockpile of nuclear weapons safe and reliable without nuclear testing, as well as cleaning up nuclear contamination and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and terrorism.

Now that the Cold War is over, these tenets no longer command widespread public or congressional support in the United States. A sustainable and bipartisan basis for future US policies geared toward the reduction of nuclear dangers must be built on different ground. While nuclear deterrence will remain important in the twenty-first century, Cold War conceptions of MAD can no longer guide future US decisions regarding nuclear weapons and missile defences.

It discusses this issue with the help of an historical analogy that compares the U.S. decision to build NMD to the Athenian decision in 479 BC to build its Long Walls linking Athens and its major seaport. First, the paper defines the three elements of U.S. nuclear deterrence posture: retaliation, defense, and dissuasion. Then, the paper establishes the current state of those three elements. The elements of strategic deterrence are assessed to determine their suitability to deter twenty-first century threats. To do this, current threats are examined and compared to the deterrent elements. The assessment reveals that the deterrence elements cannot meet the new security challenges, and recommends a re-balancing of the elements. Adjusting this balance will incur risks, and those risks are explored. The discussion of risks focuses on both the policy and technical risks of the suggested changes. By the end of this paper it will hopefully be clear that U.S. nuclear deterrence policy should be modified with the addition of an active defense component to meet twenty-first century security challenges.",,2001,,,,"Lynch, James H.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091612092,0,"[Solem, Erik]|[]|Études Internationales|1990|21|3|619-621|10.7202/702713ar|pub.1015618320|1"
pub.1091774163,10.21236/ada441569,Deterrence in the National Security of a Middle-Sized Country,"The idea of deterrence is rather simple and refers to military strategy under which one power uses a threat to preclude an attack from an adversary power. The word ""deterrence"" is derived from the Latin de + terrere and literally means ""to frighten from"" or ""to frighten away."" Thus, threat and fear are central to the original meaning of deterrence. Military deterrence and its application in various forms has a long tradition in the art of war. In the early history of humankind, the main method of deterring an enemy was to capture the attention of his senses, mostly visual and auditory, and thereby to activate the enemy's imagination. To frighten a foe, bright colors on the body and weaponry were used; warriors in their outfits imitated fearsome animals, or generated frightening sounds, such as, for example, during the famous Battle of Vienna (1683) when Polish cavalry, known as ""winged horsemen,"" charged the enemy. With time, military inventions and development of new means of fighting increased the efficacy and credibility of deterrence. The use of artillery, balloons, and airplanes from the beginning of the 20th century was considered as one of the means of deterrence before World War II (Olszewski 1998: 9-13). The end of World War II, and the use of nuclear weapons, started a new era in military deterrence. During the Cold War, nuclear weapons became the central element in the defense of the nuclear powers.",,2001,,,,"Olszewski, Ryszard",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091774163,0,"[Maxwell, Stephen]|[]|The Adelphi Papers|1968|8|50|1-19|10.1080/05679326808448106|pub.1020181040|18;[Lebow, Richard Ned; Stein, Janice Gross]|[ur.011434531375.46; ur.013222707512.19]|Political Science Quarterly|1995|110|2|157|10.2307/2152358|pub.1069792357|18;[Singer, J.

Concern about the introduction of weapons of mass destruction is not a new consideration in the Middle East.

This paper will address the complex problem of arms control and the trend to control armament in the Middle East including President Bush's initiative in may 1991 and the ACRS meetings. It contends that the end of the Cold War brought to the forefront additional economic pressures on the major arms suppliers, and the end of the Gulf War that directed the world towards a comprehensive arms control policy to stop the dangers posed by unrestrained militarization.

Nuclear doctrine has to be ultimately tested in the crucible of operational reality.

For more that half its history as an independent state Cyprus has been under occupation following the 1974 Turkish invasion.

The average defence burden—military expenditure as a share of GDP—during 1964–98 was around 2.5%. However, as a result of a substantial shift in defence policy during the past decade or so, the defence burden during the 1990s has increased, averaging about 4% of GDP as Cyprus decided to implement an extensive military modernization program aiming to present a more credible military deterrence vis‐a‐vis Turkey.

Not simply a scheme to gain international aid and hard cash, the missile program has thus come to assume a strategic position for Pyongyang. This article outlines the history of the missile program, takes a look at missile capabilities, and discusses implications such as the threat perceived by Japan and the United States, sales to the Middle East and South Ask, and their value as a shield against outside pressure. Above all, they help ensure the survival of the Pyongyang regime. The article goes on to detail American policy responses including TMD, conventional deterrence including preemptive strikes (not appropriate for the Korean situation), the MTCR, and the negotiation track. For South Korea, the author suggests a combination of deterrence through enhanced missile capability of its own and continued engagement policy. North Korea is consistent with its pattern of flexing military muscle then demanding a price. So long as this keeps working, Pyongyang is unlikely to dismantle its missile program. The only possible trade-off might be the combination of US forces withdrawal and South Korea's gradual political submission—too high a price. North Korea thus will not relinquish its leverage—barring a major change domestically that could possibly call for a broader peace dividend, but that may not be possible without a genuine reconciliation based on peaceful coexistence.",Korean Journal of Defense Analysis,2000,12,1,131-154,"Lee, Jung-Hoon; Cho, II Hyun",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021704046,2,"[Cambone, Stephen A.]|[ur.011157753015.85]|Survival|1997|39|3|66-84|10.1080/00396339708442927|pub.1026831503|9;[Bracken, Paul]|[]|Orbis|1995|39|1|55-64|10.1016/0030-4387(95)90053-5|pub.1046382084|6;[Harding, Harry]|[]|Asia-Pacific Review|1999|6|1|7-24|10.1080/13439009908720002|pub.1050883643|2;[Walt, Stephen M.]|[ur.011212666051.94]|World Politics|1992|44|3|321-368|10.2307/2010542|pub.1053127298|50;[Gambhir, Senjiv S.]|[ur.0616337446.39]||1999||||10.21236/ada385898|pub.1091782492|1"

As a result, preventing WMD employment must become an international priority. A blueprint for this strategy is available in the form of traditional nuclear deterrence tenets. In order to deter WMD attack, the US must be able to survive a first strike, retain the capability for overwhelming retaliation, cultivate national will, and maintain irrefutable credibility. With nuclear deterrence theory as a benchmark, this paper focuses on bolstering US credibility by identifying inconsistent areas within current US strategy and offering recommendations. Critical areas include highlighting US engagement and communication as key steps to effective worldwide WMD deterrence; appropriately demonstrating US national will to potential WMD users; and communicating a flexible targeting strategy that holds at risk an adversary's valued elements. A coherent WMD deterrence strategy's goal is complete prevention of WMD use. However, failure must be anticipated and resulting actions should prevent future WMD attacks and contribute to US credibility while strengthening the deterrent strategy. With absolute credibility the US will be able to continue to exert international leadership in an increasingly hazardous future.",,2000,,,,"Jurewicz, Don",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091589918,0,

India, non-proliferation, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty","This article examines the Indian nuclear tests of May 1998 and accounts for the events by locating them at the centre of a dynamic interaction between domestic and international change. Since the late 1980s, a change in Indian domestic opinion towards the utility of nuclear weapons occurred against a serious hiatus in the emergent international regime established to prevent horizontal nuclear proliferation. The rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and their assertion of a more realist version of power, premised on the symbolic power of nuclear weapons, made it vital for India to claim the right for a limited nuclear deterrence before international opinion hardened around US President Bill Clinton's sponsored Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Though the BJP lay claim to previously established Indian critiques of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the CTBT, they sought to take advantage of the deliberate hypocrisy between nuclear arms control and arms reduction in a way distinct from both Congress and former United Front governments. They sought not to further disarmament, but to create the context in which they could weaponise with impunity. The article believes that the only way the BJP's growing affinity with nuclear weapons can be undermined is for the current nuclear weapon states to, ironically, take seriously earlier Indian thinking on the need to address the global elimination of nuclear weapons.",Contemporary South Asia,2000,9,1,25-39,"Hewitt, Vernon",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024070105,1,"[Singh, Jaswant]|[]||1999||||10.1007/978-1-349-27191-7|pub.1022763894|27;[Kamath, P.M.]|[]|Strategic Analysis|1999|22|12|1933-1953|10.1080/09700169908458932|pub.1048513477|3;[Walker, William]|[]|International Affairs|1998|74|3|505-528|10.1111/1468-2346.00031|pub.1049222429|13"

Central to Whitehall's concern was the discovery of some means of reducing the cost of maintaining Britain's three main strategic roles ‐ nuclear deterrence, the defence of western Europe and East of Suez. It was clear that Britain should not, and could not, maintain these three roles indefinitely, a view which was shared by Labour ministers at the Chequers meeting. This article examines the evolution of Whitehall's thinking on Britain's long‐term world role during the period before and after Labour came into power in October 1964, and concludes that British ministers and officials began to consider Britain's eventual disengagement from bases East of Suez, a disengagement which was finally announced by the Wilson government in July 1967.",Diplomacy and Statecraft,2000,11,1,211-240,"Dockrill, Saki",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013306505,3,"[Heuser, Beatrice]|[ur.013771636031.32]||1997||||10.1057/9780230377622|pub.1013514951|32;[Tratt, Jacqueline]|[]||1996||||10.1057/9780230377714|pub.1013848730|12;[Melissen, Jan]|[]|Diplomacy and Statecraft|1996|7|3|652-687|10.1080/09592299608406020|pub.1016963964|5;[Steininger, Rolf]|[]|Diplomacy and Statecraft|1997|8|3|237-285|10.1080/09592299708406065|pub.1026752948|3;[Baylis, John]|[]||1989||||10.1007/978-1-349-19823-8|pub.1034836486|17;[Stromseth, Jane E.]|[]||1988||||10.1007/978-1-349-08518-7|pub.1036905155|49;[Dockrill, Saki]|[ur.010376621631.42]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1997|20|3|45-70|10.1080/01402399708437687|pub.1042608921|4;[Straw, Sean; Young, John W.]|[; ]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1997|20|4|18-44|10.1080/01402399708437697|pub.1044553747|5;[Nuti, Leopoldo]|[ur.012626724063.18]|Diplomacy and Statecraft|1993|4|1|114-148|10.1080/09592299308405876|pub.1046977935|9;[YOUNG, JOHN W.]|[]|Review of International Studies|1998|24|4|545-562|10.1017/s0260210598005452|pub.1053755882|9;[Dumbrell, John]|[ur.014645373050.30]|Journal of American Studies|1996|30|2|211-231|10.1017/s0021875800027055|pub.1054086271|17;[Kent, John; Young, John W.]|[; ]|Securing Peace in Europe, 1945–62|1992|||41-61|10.1007/978-1-349-21810-3_3|pub.1084919466|4;[Haftendorn, Helga]|[]||1996||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198280033.001.0001|pub.1098721034|30;[Navias, Martin S.]|[ur.012377044574.41]||1991||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198277545.001.0001|pub.1098741026|31;[Baylis, John]|[]||1995||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198280125.001.0001|pub.1098743460|53"

For the United States Air Force (USAF), this has meant short-notice deployments, airlifts, and other operational missions conducted in reaction to local crises. Such missions-once of secondary importance to nuclear deterrence or preparations for theater war-have come to dominate Air Force operations. The result has been recognition that global aerospace power and mobility are central to effective American crisis intervention in the post-Cold War world. This recognition has led the U.S. Air Force to restructure itself as an Expeditionary Aerospace Force, exploiting diverse core competencies consisting of global air and space superiority, rapid global mobility, precision engagement, global attack, information superiority, and agile combat support. Via rapid-response air expeditionary forces, the U.S. Air Force can furnish global power and presence for humanitarian or combat purposes-bombs or bread or both-in hours to any spot on Earth. A traditional precept of USAF doctrine has been that the service must always be prepared to assess its roles and missions in light of new and ever-changing national policy and strategy.

Earliest signs of a new foreign policy were the negotiated settlement of the Namibian dispute in the late 1980s and the termination of South Africa's nuclear deterrence programme which opened up the prospect of closer collaboration in Africa and admission to global efforts to stem proliferation. The rapid pace of change meant that, by the time the Government of National Unity assumed power in 1994, some of the African National Council's foreign policy and diplomatic initiatives have been overtaken. After 1994 the priority shifted to Africa, the southern hemisphere and the Non-Aligned Movement, and to universal moral and humanitarian issues. The author reviews the consistency of policy in subsequent years, South African initiatives on Nigeria, Libya and Lesotho, and the adoption of a new set of priorities in the early part of 1999.",The Round Table,1999,88,352,585-620,"Muller, Marie",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011057248,1,

Nuclear deterrence remains highly relevant to the new world order because of residual great power nuclear arsenals and nuclear proliferation. In addition, the possible combination of information warfare and a failure of nuclear deterrence is one troublesome aspect of the future technology and policy environment. Stable nuclear deterrence depends upon an environment of mutual confidence and accurate information exchange between potential adversaries, especially during crises. Information warfare is intended to corrupt the information environment of potential-opponents before a war begins or during it.

Rational choice models have provided the foundation for theorizing about the conditions under which conventional deterrence is likely to succeed or fail. Rational deterrence theorists have focused on four sets of variables: the balance of military forces, costly signaling and bargaining behavior, reputations, and interests at stake. Over the past two decades, scholars have tested propositions from rational deterrence theory utilizing both statistical and comparative case study methods. Although the empirical results from these tests have supported a number of hypotheses derived from the theoretical literature, they have also challenged some theoretical arguments and have sparked vigorous debates about both theory and research designs for conducting empirical research.",Annual Review of Political Science,1999,2,1,25-48,"Huth, Paul K.",University of Michigan,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042694520,72,"[Huth, Paul K.]|[ur.016301126663.22]|Security Studies|1997|7|1|72-99|10.1080/09636419708429334|pub.1006837976|59;[Nalebuff, Barry]|[]|World Politics|1991|43|3|313-335|10.2307/2010397|pub.1007188286|52;[Fearon, James D.]|[ur.0773121250.02]|American Political Science Review|1994|88|3|577-592|10.2307/2944796|pub.1007377109|952;[Fearon, James D.]|[ur.0773121250.02]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1994|38|2|236-269|10.1177/0022002794038002004|pub.1007514612|190;[Leng, Russell J.]|[ur.01271507234.02]|American Political Science Review|1984|78|2|338-355|10.2307/1963368|pub.1010805282|37;[Glaser, Charles L.]|[ur.013136155725.83]|World Politics|1997|50|1|171-201|10.1017/s0043887100014763|pub.1011732230|142;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|World Politics|1979|31|2|289-324|10.2307/2009945|pub.1013991718|128;[Huth, Paul; Gelpi, Christopher; Bennett, D.

pub.1058394087,10.1080/14672715.1999.10415740,Why India and Pakistan should denuclearize and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,"Although it was claimed that the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests of May 1998 were greeted with popular jubilation in both countries, in reality they were followed by heightened fear and insecurity among many people and a deep sense of loss at the abandonment of nuclear disarmament in favor of nuclear deterrence, implying the willingness of their states to inflict death and terrible suffering on civilian populations. Reversing this destructive logic would require mass movements for nuclear disarmament in both countries. A limited goal could be a nuclear-weapons-free South Asia; this would avert the immediate risk of a deliberate or accidental nuclear exchange. In addition, it would require participation in the movement for global disarmament. The next step in this process is signing and ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Prior to the tests, a systematic campaign against the CTBT launched by the pro-nuclear lobby succeeded in confusing the issue considerably, but an examination of their arguments shows that none of them are valid. Denuclearization and signing the CTBT would represent a return to a nuclear disarmament agenda and should be supported by Marxists as a strengthening of international working class solidarity against the repressive machinery of the state.",Critical Asian Studies,1999,31,2,23-36,"Hensman, Rohini",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1058394087,0,

Indeed, Edwards' closed world is a caricature of the real world of Cold War and American nuclear strategy. His account of the imaginary world and its development draws on and perpetuates the folklore of Cold War and American nuclear strategy. The folklore, which fails to acknowledge the frightening realities of the strategy of nuclear deterrence, has achieved a high level of academic respectability in the United States and elsewhere. Even though Edwards does not simply accept the folklore chapter and verse, enough of it survives intact in his book to leave his history of computers in the Cold War wanting at key stages and in important respects. Because he likens nuclear war to a computer game, he seriously underestimates the grave risks and dangers that accompanied American preparations and planning for nuclear war with the Soviet Union. In the end, Edwards trivialises the deadly serious business of nuclear war planning and preparation.",Prometheus,1999,17,2,211-224,"RIX, MARK",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031445708,0,

pub.1005940177,10.1177/0022343399036002005,Neoidealism and the Democratic Peace,"While analysts hail the democratic peace as an empirical vindication of neoidealist precepts of world politics, actually it is inconsistent with them. Neoidealism focuses on the role of international regimes - not shared political regime type - in reducing the probability of interstate conflict. In this article, I suggest a more consistent neoidealist conceptualization of the stability among democratic dyads. Focusing on the postwar era, I maintain that a combination of factors, including bipolarity, nuclear deterrence, alliance membership, and trade links, contributed to the formation of an international security regime among the major power democracies and their minor power democratic allies. Further, I maintain that the presence of this international regime and not simply joint democracy allowed for the postwar stability among democratic dyads. While democracy may have been associated with the creation of a security regime at the behest of the Western democracies led by the USA, the expansion and maintenance of this regime (and its conflict dampening attributes) are rooted, to a greater extent, in the interplay of alliance-aggregation and security externalities of trade. This argument is consistent with neoidealist precepts and by focusing on the role of security regimes it contributes to the neoidealist research program.",Journal of Peace Research,1999,36,2,203-231,"Henderson, Errol A.",University of Florida,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005940177,11,"[Maoz, Zeev]|[ur.07510606515.05]|International Security|1997|22|1|162-198|10.1162/isec.22.1.162|pub.1001143593|43;[Morgan, T.

pub.1019999193,10.1177/0022343399036002002,Nuclear Deterrence in the Developing World: A Game-Theoretic Treatment,"There has been an increasing debate over the consequences of proliferation and the viability of deterrence in the newly-nuclear states, with the scholarly community generally splitting into two opposed and mutually exclusive groups. One set of scholars believes in the efficacy of deterrence and thus tends to favor proliferation, while another loose grouping of research efforts questions the viability of deterrence in the developing countries. The former group has generally pitched its arguments at an abstract level (primarily through non-formal research), while the latter group has based its critiques on specific countries or on subtopics within the theory of deterrence (such as the fragility of command and control systems). This article is an attempt to synthesize and formalize the key questions and concepts of this debate through both a literature review and a game model of complete and perfect information that allows for crisis escalation at the conventional and nuclear levels of conflict. After noting several logical inconsistencies in the extant pro-proliferation and pro-deterrence research, the article resolves many of the key issues through a formal study of the interactions between threat credibility, threat capability, and the dynamics of escalation. The results show some severe weaknesses in the pro-proliferation school: nuclear blackmail is still a possibility in dyads that experience asymmetric proliferation or in dyads where threat credibility at the nuclear level favors one side; nuclear weapons generally fail to bridge the gap left by incapable conventional forces; and status quo stability is intimately tied to variations in preference orderings, even when both sides possess capable nuclear threats.

If the Soviets threatened war in Europe, the United States would guarantee the uneasy peace achieved in 1945, if necessary by nuclear retaliation against the Soviet homeland. As students of the early Cold War have stressed for some years, this strategy was based on domestic prerequisites. It was necessary to rally the country and coordinate its institutions in order to sustain what President John F. Kennedy retrospectively called ‘a long twilight struggle’ in support of a new conception of national security.

Whilst financial constraints required the government to pursue a defence policy more orientated towards nuclear rather than conventional deterrence,1 in the aftermath of the crisis two conflicting defence policy strategies emerged. On the one hand, Suez highlighted doubts surrounding the reliability of the American nuclear guarantee and encouraged dedication to an independent British deterrent force. It also succeeded, however, in reinforcing the lesson that American acquiescence was at least desirable, if not necessary, in order for Britain to consider unilateral action again. Thus developed in Britain a curious paradox - a policy of independence as a means of influencing the United States, retaining world-wide prestige and national pride that appeared to co-exist alongside a rhetoric of interdependence with the United States.",Harold Macmillan Aspects of a Political Life,1999,,,217-241,"Murray, Donette",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040980913,0,

pub.1017624442,10.1017/cbo9780511527364.001,Introduction: The Moral and Political Philosophy of Gregory Kavka,"Gregory Kavka was a remarkable philosopher, certainly, to have written so many distinguished essays and books in his short life, for he was only forty-six when he died on February 16, 1994. Even greater testimony to his exceptional nature as a thinker may be his influence on contemporary moral and political philosophy. His contributions to several areas of practical philosophy are significant. His work falls into four overlapping areas: (1) the ethics of war – in particular, the ethics and rationality of nuclear policy; (2) the general theory of rational choice; (3) Hobbes studies; and (4) various topics in moral theory, applied ethics, and policy. In each of these areas his contributions have been striking and have opened new areas of thought. Kavka wrote extensively about the ethics of war and of defense, especially nuclear conflict and its deterrence. His writings kindled contemporary interest in the philosophical and ethical issues concerning nuclear war. Most importantly, they showed how wider lessons are to be found in seemingly narrow issues about aspects of nuclear deterrence and policy. In a well-known and widely reprinted essay, “Some Paradoxes of Deterrence” (1978), Kavka showed how certain sorts of deterrent situations give rise to moral difficulties with which our standard accounts are ill equipped to deal. These situations are those in which an agent must intend (conditionally) to harm innocent people in order to forestall some great harm and injustice.",Rational Commitment and Social Justice,1998,,,1-8,"Morris, Christopher W.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017624442,0,

pub.1009758447,10.1017/cbo9780511558962.005,Nuclear lessons of the Cold War,"The role of nuclear weapons in Soviet–US relations has been hotly debated. Politicians, generals and most academic strategists believe that the United States' nuclear arsenal restrained the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War. Critics maintain that nuclear weapons were a root cause of superpower conflict and a threat to peace. Controversy also surrounds the number and kinds of weapons necessary to deter, the political implications of the strategic balance, and the role of nuclear deterrence in hastening the collapse of the Soviet imperium. Careful analysts were alert to the difficulty of making definitive judgements about deterrence in the absence of valid and reliable information about Soviet and Chinese objectives and calculations (MccGwire, 1985/6; Betta, 1987; Bundy, 1988). Newly declassified documents and extensive interviews with Soviet and US officials permit a reconstuction of the deliberations of leaders of both superpowers before, during and after the two most serious nuclear crises of the last thirty years: the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 and the superpower crisis arising out of the 1973 Middle East war. This evidence sheds new light on some of the controversies at the centre of the nuclear debate (Lebow and Stein, 1994). Needless to say, definitive judgements must await the opening of archives and more complete information about the calculations of Soviet and US leaders in other crises, as well as those of other nuclear powers. Restraining, provocative or irrelevant? Students of nuclear deterrence distinguish between general and immediate deterrence (Morgan, 1977).",Statecraft and Security,1998,,,71-86,"Lebow, Richard Ned; Stein, Janice Gross",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1009758447,1,

pub.1115132518,10.11375/kokusaiseiji1957.117_1,The End of Security?: Politics of Fear and Safety,"During the past five decades, the most impressive intellectual achievements in international relations have been accomplished in the area of security studies. These include the studies of nuclear deterrence and arms control, alliances, crisis management, and the decision-making processes of major crises and wars. A galaxy of scholars, such as Bernard Brodie, Arnold Wolfers, John H. Herz, Henry A. Kissinger, Thomas C. Schelling, Hedley Bull, Alexander L. George, and Joseph S. Nye, Jr., have undertaken to deal with these security problems. Yet, as the Cold War has ended, security concerns have faded out considerably. As a result, some believe that we have come to the end of the history of security and that, therefore, “security studies are dead.” Is this true? Eleven articles, including mine, try to answer this question one way or another. In my article, I shall attempt to define the concept of security, which has remained ambiguous to the present time. Special attention is paid to the relationship between security and power based on the studies of Harold Lasswell and A. Wolfers. Second, I shall trace the formation of the security concept in tandem with the birth of the nation-state system. Third, I shall examine whether we should expand the security concept to include such issues as economic and environmental problems with the end of the Cold War. Finally, I shall give some introductory remarks on the other ten articles in this volume. The first three articles deal with the concepts on the international system level: namely, security regime (Yamamoto), three global security frameworks (Inoguchi), and international anarchy (Ishida). The next three analyze renewed concerns over environmental issues (Ohta), human security (Kurusu), and total nuclear disarmament (Umemoto). The next two articles (Sakai and Nakanishi) focus on domestic debates on Japanese security policies. The last two articles (Fukushima and Ueta) analyze the role alliances play in stabilizing/destabilizing the international system. Most of these articles are suggesting that we should go beyond the traditional bounds of security studies. Interestingly, however, none of them propound the end of security. Hopefully, this volume will provide a ground plan on which to locate redefined security concepts and policies in the years to come.",International Relations,1998,1998,117,"1-20,l5","TSUCHIYAMA, Jitsuo",Aoyama Gakuin University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115132518,0,"[Jetschke, Anja]|[ur.011734535654.08]|Klassiker der Sozialwissenschaften|2016|||383-387|10.1007/978-3-658-13213-2_89|pub.1043579805|31"

Nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZ) are legal mechanisms for the former and political stepping stones towards the latter. The worldwide outrage and disbelief provoked by the French decision to resume nuclear testing in 1995 confirmed both the public revulsion against nuclear weapons and their associated infrastructure, and the general belief that they are problems left over from the history of the Cold War. There is a growing strategic disconnect between the unaltered theology of nuclear deterrence, on the one hand, and, on the other, the military and political reality of reduced nuclear stockpiles and increasing normative constraints on the usability of nuclear weapons.

Meanwhile, South Asia remains locked in an undeclared nuclear deterrence involving its two major states, India and Pakistan.

By considering demand and supply factors, the old approaches that rely on limits on the technology or supply appear inadequate in the current situation Rather, the best approaches today are those that influence demand, making it less attractive for nations to develop nuclear weapons. The constraints on the United States that inhibit it from using its nuclear weapons to threaten new nuclear states make both nuclear deterrence and guarantees to countries not acquiring such weapons ineffectual in preventing further proliferation. The use of conventional forces to prevent proliferation or to protect threatened nations may also be politically difficult unless there are clear national interests at stake. A possible way out of this dilemma is to develop a system of conventional deterrence using precision guided munitions and other recent technological developments that have increased the accuracy of weapons delivery systems. Such a system of conventional deterrence could play an important role in making nuclear weapons of less perceived value to potentially proliferating nations and in protecting regions that these nations threaten.",Economic Affairs,1997,17,4,4-9,"Brito, Dagobert L.; Intriligator, Michael D.","University of California, Los Angeles",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021152736,0,"[Intriligator, Michael D.; Brito, Dagobert L.]|[ur.013222136254.32; ur.011606711745.78]|Public Choice|1981|37|2|247-260|10.1007/bf00138245|pub.1001826668|39;[Brito, Dagobert L.; Intriligator, Michael D.]|[ur.011606711745.78; ur.013222136254.32]|American Political Science Review|1985|79|4|943-957|10.2307/1956242|pub.1009281109|79;[Fischer, D.; May, Michael]|[; ]|Physics Today|1993|46|9|66-66|10.1063/1.2809043|pub.1057870977|1;[Tsipis, Kosta; Gordon, J.

Bernard Brodie called for development of strategic studies on the model of the discipline of economics, because neither the military nor academia treated the subject rigorously. His call was answered in the early cold war, with mixed results. Theories about nuclear deterrence burgeoned while empirical studies of war lagged. The late—cold war impasse in nuclear strategy, rooted in NATO doctrine, shifted attention to conventional military operations and empirically grounded theory. Since the cold war, research on general theoretical questions about war and peace has been prospering, but education in military matters has been eroding. Interdisciplinary strategic studies integrate political and military elements of international conflict, but there is no recognized discipline of military science; military analysis is smuggled into political science and history departments, where it is resisted by calls to conceptualize security broadly or focus on purely theoretical work. If serious military studies are squeezed out of universities, there will be no qualified civilian analysts to provide independent expertise in policy and budget debates, and decisions on war and peace will be made irresponsibly by uninformed civilians or by the professional military alone.",World Politics,1997,50,1,7-33,"Betts, Richard K.",Columbia University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050408300,51,"[Bull, Hedley]|[]|World Politics|1968|20|4|593-605|10.2307/2009685|pub.1004217218|23;[Zisk, Kimberly Marten]|[ur.014213755111.95]||1993||||10.1515/9781400820931|pub.1005780259|40;[Biddle, Stephen D.]|[]|Survival|1988|30|2|99-121|10.1080/00396338808442399|pub.1009970102|9;[Knorr, Klaus]|[]|World Politics|1964|16|3|455-467|10.2307/2009582|pub.1010238093|26;[David, Steven R.]|[]|World Politics|1991|43|2|233-256|10.2307/2010472|pub.1012976295|174;[Knorr, Klaus Eugen]|[ur.011510220167.48]||1959||||10.1515/9781400878246|pub.1014434359|23;[Davis, Christopher Mark]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1996|19|1|31-73|10.1080/01402399608437626|pub.1015363226|3;[Kaufmann, Chaim]|[]|International Security|1996|20|4|136-175|10.1162/isec.20.4.136|pub.1016246865|289;[Brodie, Bernard]|[]|World Politics|1949|1|4|467-488|10.2307/2008833|pub.1018175009|45;[Snyder, Glenn Herald]|[]||1961||||10.1515/9781400877164|pub.1018970969|179;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]||1989||||10.1007/978-1-349-20165-5|pub.1019965352|67;[Kupchan, Charles A.]|[ur.07471034401.72]|World Politics|1989|41|4|536-578|10.2307/2010529|pub.1020935858|6;[Steinbruner, John]|[]|World Politics|1976|28|2|223-245|10.2307/2009891|pub.1024114052|28;[Hirschman, Albert O.]|[ur.010335051525.04]|World Politics|1970|22|3|329-343|10.2307/2009600|pub.1028786925|108;[Friedberg, Aaron L.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1980|3|3|37-71|10.1080/01402398008437055|pub.1039830104|19;[Betts, Richard K.]|[]|World Politics|1985|37|2|153-179|10.2307/2010141|pub.1040254276|22;[Hitch, Charles J.]|[]|World Politics|1960|12|3|434-452|10.2307/2009400|pub.1044860329|6;[Posen, Barry R.]|[ur.012671322521.68]|Survival|1993|35|1|27-47|10.1080/00396339308442672|pub.1046415303|506;[Betts, Richard K.]|[ur.012232057241.96]|World Politics|1978|31|1|61-89|10.2307/2009967|pub.1046617509|127;[Crawford, Neta C.]|[ur.013547650535.80]|Security Studies|1991|1|2|283-316|10.1080/09636419109347469|pub.1053519625|17;[BALDWIN, DAVID A.]|[]|Review of International Studies|1997|23|1|5-26|10.1017/s0260210597000053|pub.1053820338|294;[Steinbruner, John D.]|[]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1978|22|3|411-428|10.1177/002200277802200303|pub.1053971252|16;[Feaver, Peter D.]|[ur.015500642107.24]|Armed Forces & Society|1996|23|2|149-178|10.1177/0095327x9602300203|pub.1063730689|135;[Baldwin, David A.]|[]|World Politics|1995|48|1|117-141|10.1353/wp.1995.0001|pub.1065052811|72;[Ullman, Richard H.]|[]|International Security|1983|8|1|129|10.2307/2538489|pub.1069980199|322;[Ball, Desmond]|[]|International Security|1982|7|3|31|10.2307/2538550|pub.1069980251|30;[Evera, Stephen Van]|[ur.013530612333.14]|International Security|1984|9|1|58|10.2307/2538636|pub.1069980326|136;[Mearsheimer, John J.]|[]|International Security|1989|13|4|54|10.2307/2538780|pub.1069980447|41;[Epstein, Joshua M.]|[]|International Security|1989|13|4|90|10.2307/2538781|pub.1069980448|19;[Cohen, Eliot A.]|[]|International Security|1988|13|1|50|10.2307/2538896|pub.1069980537|29;[Lepingwell, John W.

Although Jerusalem is taking ambitious steps to augment these fragile foundations with sophisticated active defenses (e.g., the ""Arrow"" ATBM), the Israeli deployment of antitactical ballistic missiles by the year 2000 will be inherently problematic. Moreover, the interim period of vulnerability will provide would-be aggressors with both an incentive and an opportunity to attack in the near term. With these facts in mind, this article points to various ways in which Israel should strengthen its nuclear deterrence posture and ways in which it should not seek security beyond the protections afforded by this posture. Thus, the argument identifies essential Israeli preparations for conventional preemptive attacks against certain enemy hard targets and for enhanced conventional deterrence. Finally, after examining some of the expected consequences of a regional nuclear war for Israel, it advances the case for a new Israeli strategic dialectic and looks productively at prospective deterrence benefits for Israel of preparations for the Samson Option, concluding with a plea that Israel's leaders promptly identify those precise configurations of nuclear deterrence, conventional deterrence, preemption, and multilayered active defenses that would be optimal for the Jewish State.",Armed Forces & Society,1997,23,4,541-570,"Beres, Louis Renέ",Purdue University West Lafayette,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063730718,1,

Specifically, the study documents the frequency and severity of acts of international terrorism over a forty‐one‐month period centered on the date of the raid. Findings indicate that the level of activity of Libyan‐associated terrorist groups and, after a brief upsurge, the frequency of attacks against U.S. targets both declined after the raid. Whereas the number of acts of international terrorism worldwide was similar for the periods before and after the operation, the postraid period was characterized by a shift from acts of medium and high severity to acts of low severity in violence.

This definition is not only consistent with a broad range of etymological sources, but is also in agreement with numerous examples from the historical and anthropological record. A possible application of the hostage idea to mid/late-twentieth-century superpower relationships, involving a distinctively different approach to nuclear deterrence, is also described. Attention is further called to the fact that the giving of hostages as confidence-building “emissaries of trust” incorporates several attributes that might be of interest to contemporary evolutionary theorists. A closer examination of the biological and behavioral underpinnings, the historical and anthropological precedents, and the political and psychological efficacy of this ancient idea might therefore prove to be a fruitful area for future empirical and theoretical research.",Politics and the Life Sciences,1997,16,1,77-85,"Smail, J.

Smith provides a summary of Walzer's work, with particular emphasis on his method of moral argument. Walzer's argument focuses on moral norms or “practical” morality, but ultimately emphasizes the importance of moral judgment based on the principle of human rights rather than on utilitarian calculation. Addressing realists' critiques of Walzer, in particular David C. Hendrickson's (see below), Smith reaffirms Walzer's call for the need to constrain the realist doctrine of necessity, which argues that moral considerations should be subordinate to the security of the state.

The article questions the relevance of Cold War nuclear deterrence policies in the post‐Cold War world, focusing on the obsolescence of past theoretical and historical justifications of such policies given fundamental changes in both actual nuclear force deployments and general political conditions. The operating premise of the article is that extended nuclear deterrence in Northeast Asia is already eroding, in fact if not in policy, insofar as changing force structures and political conditions have worked to undermine the credibility of extended deterrent threats. The article considers present security circumstances in light of the actual status of the policy of extended nuclear deterrence, and assesses the potential security implications of explicitly revoking such policies. The article concludes that such a policy shift could serve greatly to reduce incentives for proliferation in the region as well as promote efforts toward counter‐proliferation and nuclear weapons abolition globally.",Pacifica Review Peace Security & Global Change,1997,9,2,39-56,"Huntley, Wade",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032217374,0,"[Cambone, Stephen A.; Garrity, Patrick J.]|[ur.011157753015.85; ]|Survival|1994|36|4|73-95|10.1080/00396339408442764|pub.1022551324|10;[Huntley, Wade]|[]|The Nonproliferation Review|1996|4|1|1-16|10.1080/10736709608436649|pub.1038032004|4;[Yost, David S.]|[]|Survival|1993|35|3|97-120|10.1080/00396339308442701|pub.1052855859|8;[Katzenstein, Peter J.; Okawara, Nobuo]|[ur.015565033657.08; ur.013726341433.37]|International Security|1993|17|4|84|10.2307/2539023|pub.1069980638|66;[Berger, Thomas U.]|[]|International Security|1993|17|4|119|10.2307/2539024|pub.1069980639|93;[Johnston, Alastair Iain]|[ur.012057106077.76]|International Security|1995|20|3|5|10.2307/2539138|pub.1069980715|57;[Roy, Denny]|[]|International Security|1994|19|1|149|10.2307/2539151|pub.1069980727|82;[Friedberg, Aaron L.]|[]|International Security|1993|18|3|5|10.2307/2539204|pub.1069980759|253;[Betts, Richard K.]|[]|International Security|1993|18|3|34|10.2307/2539205|pub.1069980760|108;[Ball, Desmond]|[]|International Security|1993|18|3|78|10.2307/2539206|pub.1069980761|57;[Huntley, Wade L.]|[ur.015401577352.14]|International Studies Quarterly|1996|40|1|45|10.2307/2600931|pub.1070020722|47"

This article looks at key trends in global politics, and the sources and nature of future conflicts in the Asia‐Pacific with respect to the next 50 years.

In Asia, the probability of a medium‐intensity conflict in the foreseeable future is higher than that of a high‐intensity or low‐intensity conflict. Future war will be a war about time, not about ground. Conditions of nuclear deterrence will apply, but info‐war and space capabilities will assume greater significance. Integrated joint warfare— Air, Land, Sea, Space interface—will be a key feature of future war.

The motivation of this"" open nuclear option"" of Japan would be mainly the development of the nuclear force of China. The us retreat of all the ground-launched and submarine-launched tactical nuclear weapons in 1991 implied the end of the age of dependence on tactical nuclear weapons for ""war-fighting"" in Asia. The conventional deterrence would already be sufficient for maintaining the stability of the East Asia. The mission of the extended nuclear deterrence of the United States could be reduced to Us vital role for countering only the nuclear attack of other country, not for any conventional attack. The controversies about the ""antimissile defense"" have influenced the security relationship between China and Japan. The important strategic significance of the antimissile defense for Beijing would be that a strategy of the first strike against China would be easier to consider. A theater missile defense in Japan would be less challenging for China and would be useful against the threat of missiles from North Korea. Nonetheless, a strategic missile defense could have a destabilizing impact on Sino-Japanese security relations. The Japanese nuclear policy would be a hind of ""recessive deterrence"" which operates by the potential and the possibility of developing nuclear weapons. The nuclear crisis in Korea provides a chance to observe the working dynamic of this deterrence.

In most analyses, the term ‘security’ was narrowly understood as protection of territory and population from military attack by foreign governments.

The end of the Cold War forced Finland to reconsider the premises of her neutral policy. The confrontation of two blocks, in which Finland found room to pursue neutral policy, ceased to exist, and the withdrawal of former Soviet's forces from East Eupopean countries increased the strategic importance of Nordic area Pondering these changes, Finland decided to apply for EC (EU) membership, and determined that the core of the neutral policy is military non-alignment and a credible, independent defence. As for the relationship of these policies to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) of EU, Finland takes a interpretation that observer status of WEU is compatible with the amended neutrality, as WEU is a crisis management organization. The purpose of the applicastion was to ensure its security in a changed situation by participating actively in the formation of the new security order of Europe. Toward the application to EC membership, some advocates of EC membership began to insist on the necessity to establish an institutional relationship with NATO, some maintaineded even the possibility of joining it. These arguments on NATO membership calmed down in the autumn of 1993, when the positive attitudes of Russia toward NATO turned to negative. While the major concern of Russia has been directed to the East European countries, it was highly probable that any attempt to approach NATO would strain the relationship with Russia owing to the Finnish position as a neighbouring country of Russia as well as the increased strategic importance of Nordic area In November, the then president Mauno Koivisto, made it clear that Finland would continue to pursue the neutral policy as any imminent and concrete menace against Finland was foreseeable. What was important for Finnish security was, according to the president, indirect security obtained through EU membership. The main issue for the Finnish security policy in the foreseeable future is whether the amended neutrality functions in the changed situation or not. It depends on how the EU and Russia estimate this policy. From the viewpoint of stability of Nordic area this policy could be in the interest of both. For Russia, this is a much better alternative than of Finland seeks to join WEU, whose membership could lead to the membership of NATO. For the EU whose border has come to touch with Russia, to maintain the stability is a matter of essential interest. One way to make this policy function more effectively in a way to serve for the EU and Russia may be to search for a possibility to cooperate with Sweden, as she is also a new EU member state and pursues neutrarity. Through this cooperation, neutrarity could be incorporated in CFSP as an institutionaized element. Another main issue is the validity of the concept of indirect security in the longer term. In case imminent and concrete menace emerges, would the EU membership be enough to ensure security, or should Finland consider joining NATO? If the latter's case is not excluded, this concept remains to be a transitional one. This problem of NATO membership is, however, premature. It depends ultimately on the advantages gained by NATO membership. But the function of NATO in the new security order of Europe is still unclear, especially in the context of nucler deterrence. The essential points, when Finland considers membership, are the reliability of the nuclear deterrence and the repercussion to be caused by joining NATO; among other things, endangerment of the regional stability of Nordic area.",International Relations,1996,1996,112,"158-174,l17","Yoshiaki, MIWA",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115066516,0,

They describe the current low‐level nuclear standoff as “recessed deterrence.” Nuclear weapons advocates within this group have voiced their dissatisfaction with the status quo, ostensibly because nuclear ambiguity undermines stability. This has led them to promote the concept of “minimum deterrence,” described essentially as a scaled‐down version of the superpower assured destruction doctrine. Generally, strategists that favor nuclear deployment have high confidence that India and Pakistan would be responsible nuclear powers. They also contend that just as nuclear deterrence stabilized U.S.‐Soviet relations, so too can it work for South Asia.

Although the repeated claim that a consensus existed had been used to preclude any real debate on defence policy, the Gulf War turned the limelight on a hitherto muted debate on the desirability of a changeover from a largely conscript force to a wholly professional one. The issue was discussed in the National Assembly in October 1991, and the Fondation pour les Etudes de Défense Nationale organised a workshop on the subject in February of the same year. The debate was extensively reported in the press. Some military cadres and politicians openly voiced their doubts about conscription and raised a closely related issue: that of giving financial priority to nuclear deterrence to the detriment of other arms. The White Paper implicitly acknowledged the underlying lack of consensus inasmuch as it devoted thirteen pages to refuting the arguments of those opposed to national service and a chapter to the balance to be achieved between nuclear capability and conventional arms.1 To justify its choice it put forward strategic and financial considerations, which we shall analyse.

The question of war or peace in Europe is thus not just a regional but also a global concern. Since 1945, however, Europe has been comparatively peaceful. Several factors which have been invoked to explain `the long peace' in Europe are discussed here: bipolarity, nuclear deterrence, displacement of war, interdependence, de-learning of war, a common ideology, uniting in the face of a common enemy, and democracy. While the relevance of nuclear deterrence cannot be dismissed in the case of the East-West conflict, stable democracy would seem to provide the most solid foundation for peace in Europe in the future. The peace-building functions of the European Union are mainly relevant to the extent that they contribute to the consolidation of the democratic system in new and vulnerable democracies. Today, the prospects for a lasting democratic peace in Europe are better than ever, but it will be some time before they extend to the whole continent, and the possibility of major reversals cannot be ruled out completely. A temptation may arise for democratic norms to be enforced by military means.

pub.1031458528,10.1177/0022343395032001006,Deterrence Stability with Smaller Forces: Prospects and Problems,"Many scholars and policy-makers have assumed that reduction of US and Russian strategic nuclear forces to the lowest possible levels, perhaps to zero, is contributory to deterrence and crisis stability. This study tests a variety of reduced US and Russian nuclear forces, including hypothetical forces and START configurations, for their relative force advantage and for their ability to fulfil previously accepted standards of assured retaliation. It turns out that, as forces decrease towards very low levels, the Russian force falls behind the US force in operational flexibility and becomes much more vulnerable to surprise strikes without warning. Both forces maintain the ability to inflict historically unprecedented retaliatory damage even at the 1,000 warhead level, the lowest included here. The good news is that minimum deterrent forces rapidly run out of plausible targets, making them irrelevant for counterforce first strikes or for escalation dominance. The bad news is that minimum forces can become exclusively city attacking forces by default. Former adversaries now turned into potential partners in search of regional and global stability, the USA and Russia must safeguard the transition from a nuclear deterrence regime to a more disarmed world. The reduction of US and Russian arsenals to several hundreds of weapons is contributory to stability on the assumption that the British, French and Chinese nuclear weapons inventories undergo proportionate reductions also. A second assumption built into favorable prognoses for US and Russian reductions well below START levels is that nuclear proliferation can be constrained. Absent constrained proliferation and cooperative European and Asian nuclear powers, US and Russian force reductions below 1,000 warheads are ambiguously stable. Neorealist arguments in favor of well-managed proliferation understate the extent to which Cold War stability was overdetermined. US-Soviet nuclear deterrence rested on a substructure that included bipolarity and learned behavior modification for crisis management.",Journal of Peace Research,1995,32,1,65-78,"Cimbala, Stephen J.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031458528,4,"[Mazarr, Michael J.]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|1992|15|3|183-201|10.1080/01636609209550114|pub.1030183805|5;[Miller, Steven E.]|[]||1985||||10.1515/9781400856121|pub.1038932480|20;[von Hippel, F N; Levi, B G; Postol, T A; Daugherty, W H]|[ur.0604600515.21; ur.01120160605.19; ; ur.010753572153.22]|Scientific American|1988|259|3|36-42|10.1038/scientificamerican0988-36|pub.1056600891|4;[Levi, Barbara G.; von Hippel, Frank N.; Daugherty, William H.]|[ur.01120160605.19; ur.0604600515.21; ur.010753572153.22]|International Security|1987|12|3|168|10.2307/2538804|pub.1069980466|11;[Daugherty, William; Levi, Barbara; Hippel, Frank Von]|[ur.010753572153.22; ur.01120160605.19; ur.0714423774.03]|International Security|1986|10|4|3|10.2307/2538949|pub.1069980581|23;[Mearsheimer, John J.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1993|72|3|50|10.2307/20045622|pub.1102757861|67"

En utilisant l'exemple de la dissuasion par la menace nucléaire, je montre que ceux qui sont véritablement dévoués à la protection de l'environnement, ceux qui se soucient véritablement du problème de l'environnement devraient refuser le conséquentialisme basé sur les probabilités sans le principe de la reconsideration, un principe que nous proposons ici pour la première fois, le principe de la reconsideration doit être adopté parce que, sans lui, le conséquentialisme basé sur les probabilités pourrait justifier qu'on poursuive l'application de politiques même lorsque celles-ci se sont révélées inadéquates, et même lorsqu'elles minent elles-mêmes leurs chances de succès. On peut ainsi conclure que le principe de la reconsidération est nécessaire pour assurer le lien entre les politiques justificatrices et leur succès. ABSTRACT This paper examines the making of public policy from a probability-based consequentialist perspective. Using nuclear deterrence policies as an example, I show that those truly committed environmental protection, those who truly care about the environment should not accept probability-based consequentialism without the reconsideration principle, a principle introduced in this paper.

Russia relys more on a doctrine of nuclear deterrence; thus, the absence of no‐first‐use obligation. Still, the new doctrine leaves open the possibility for unprovoked military buildup.

Game theory's relevance to peace and war was controversial from the start. The debate has continued up to the present day, but it has been conducted mostly in the abstract, with critics trying to prove a priori that game theory is inapplicable. Some aspects of international relations (IR) game theory discussed in the chapter are game analyses of specific international situations; the debate on realism and international cooperation; international negotiations; models of arms building, deterrence, and signaling resolve; the myth that game theory shaped nuclear-deterrence strategy; first-strike stability, and the outbreak of war, escalation; alliances; and arms-control verification. Game-theoretical studies of verification are divided into two groups. The first involves decisions about allocating inspection resources or a quota of inspections limited by treaty. The second asks whether to cheat and whether to accuse in the face of ambiguous evidence. The chapter also discusses military game theory.",Handbook of Game Theory with Economic Applications,1994,2,,995-1053,"O'Neill, Barry",Yale University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044320625,10,"[Morrow, James D.]|[ur.012770203755.96]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1991|35|2|245-265|10.1177/0022002791035002005|pub.1000086565|38;[Snidal, Duncan]|[ur.010273021353.18]|World Politics|1985|38|1|25-57|10.2307/2010350|pub.1000418115|100;[Quandt, Richard E.]|[ur.010117245133.25]|World Politics|1961|14|1|69-76|10.2307/2009556|pub.1001055175|5;[Powell, Robert]|[]|Cooperative Models in International Relations Research|1994|||225-243|10.1007/978-1-4615-2790-9_11|pub.1001212382|1;[Bruce, Neil]|[]|Defence Economics|1990|1|3|179-195|10.1080/10430719008404661|pub.1001946498|38;[Bansal, R.; Ba§ar, T.]|[; ur.07500672470.00]|Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications|1989|61|3|329-346|10.1007/bf00941822|pub.1002086991|10;[Brams, Steven J.; Kilgour, D.

pub.1014602534,10.1007/978-1-4615-2790-9_4,From Conflict to Cooperation in the Study of International Security,"Proposed here is a reorientation of the study of international security from its traditional emphasis on conflict to a new emphasis on cooperation. International cooperation, understood here to refer to coordinated and joint initiatives among two or more nations, has the potential of providing a new basis for international security, understood here to refer to the absence of interstate violence or hostility. Indeed, a shift from a focus on international conflict to a focus on international cooperation has the potential of providing a productive and innovative reorientation of scholarly and policy discussion in the area of international security. Past studies have emphasized potential conflict and mechanisms for conflict resolution, such as military preparedness to forestall an attack by a potential enemy; the formation of alliances; deterrence, including but not limited to nuclear deterrence; and defense, whether passive or active and whether defense of the population or defense of retaliatory weapons systems. Future studies, by contrast, might appropriately emphasize potential cooperation, such as joint and cooperative approaches to international security issues and cooperation in a wide variety of areas, including, among others, political, economic, and scientific and technical cooperation. Cooperation is, in many respects, the neglected “other side of the coin” of conflict. Many scholars have noted that international relations is not a zero-sum game, implying that there are elements of both conflict and cooperation in international relations. They then, however, typically will go on to study the conflictual aspects of international relations, whether political conflict, military confrontation, or trade disputes, ignoring actual or potential cooperative aspects of international relations, including political integration, cooperative solutions to security problems, or trade agreements and expansion.",Cooperative Models in International Relations Research,1994,,,47-73,"Intriligator, Michael D.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014602534,0,"[Brito, Dagobert L.; Intriligator, Michael D.]|[ur.011606711745.78; ur.013222136254.32]|American Political Science Review|1985|79|4|943-957|10.2307/1956242|pub.1009281109|79;[Intriligator, Michael D.; Brito, Dagobert L.]|[ur.013222136254.32; ur.011606711745.78]|Contemporary Security Policy|1985|6|1|41-57|10.1080/01440388508403811|pub.1016856909|11;[Intriligator, Michael D.; Brito, Dagobert L.]|[ur.013222136254.32; ur.011606711745.78]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1986|9|4|113-131|10.1080/01402398608437282|pub.1026258723|16;[Intriligator, Michael D.; Brito, Dagobert L.]|[ur.013222136254.32; ur.011606711745.78]|American Psychologist|1988|43|4|318-321|10.1037/0003-066x.43.4.318|pub.1044802568|4;[Intriligator, Michael D.]|[]|Security Dialogue|1989|20|2|225-227|10.1177/096701068902000214|pub.1051297032|5;[Intriligator, Michael D.]|[]|Journal of Political Economy|1975|83|2|339-354|10.1086/260326|pub.1058573807|100;[Intriligator, Michael D.; Brito, Dagobert L.]|[ur.013222136254.32; ur.011606711745.78]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1984|28|1|63-84|10.1177/0022002784028001004|pub.1063626252|90;[Liska, George]|[]|Foreign Policy|1986||63|108|10.2307/1148759|pub.1102456430|1;[Rostow, W.

The Labour government instituted a ban on visits to its ports by nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships. The high-profile dispute engaged government officials, peace activists and academics in an extended discussion of geopolitics and security policy. At least four distinct ‘geographs’ were in play in these discussions; the conventional deterrence discourse of a bipolar geopolitical confrontation between the ‘West’ and the Soviet bloc, the anti-colonial discourse of the nuclear-free zone advocates, the regional nonnuclear security policy language of the Labour government, and a more radical feminist critique of patriarchal security formulations. Focusing on the geopolitical premises of these discourses is a useful way to examine what was at stake in the construction of cold war security discourse, and allows a critical insight to its continuing influence after the cold war.",Political Geography,1993,12,5,437-456,"Dalby, Simon",Carleton University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037823500,41,"[Dalby, Simon]|[ur.016613236577.28]|Alternatives Global Local Political|1988|13|4|415-442|10.1177/030437548801300401|pub.1002747650|53;[Dalby, Simon]|[ur.016613236577.28]|Political Geography Quarterly|1990|9|2|171-188|10.1016/0260-9827(90)90017-5|pub.1005314702|55;[Runyan, Anne Sisson; Peterson, V.

pub.1091573519,10.21236/ada264171,The Operational Impact and Implications of United States Strategic Command,"As the Cold War drew to a close, a new unified command was born, that was originally conceived at the height of the Cold War in the late fifties and sixties. However, the environment of the time, specifically interservice rivalry and a fear of losing turf or mission responsibility, thwarted all efforts to implement this new command. Ironically, following the end of the epic struggle with the Soviet Union, this new command with responsibility for all strategic nuclear weapons stood up on on June 1, 1992, nearly six months after the formal demise of the Soviet Union. Is this new command needed and what can it provided? The United States Strategic Command, although conceived in a period fundamentally different from today provided the tools that are imperative to maintain a stable world in the nuclear arena. The command organization adds many advantage, including the clear separation of nuclear deterrence from conventional war fighting at the CinC level. Placing all strategic forces under a single commander offer many advantages including: producing a clearer more direct chain of command, providing unified effort to nuclear planning and execution, clearly separating the responsibilities of nuclear deterrence and conventional war fighting, and creating a single voice for all matter relating to nuclear forces. Each of these areas is vital in the near term, and the dedication of a single CinC with ultimate responsibility for these interrelated areas will increase the efficiency of forces at the operational level. While the threat of the global nuclear war has been greatly reduced, the challenges in the nuclear arena are more varied and complex than ever before, and CINCSTRAT can have a fundamental role in the shaping of this current morass",,1993,,,,"Carter, Worth",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091573519,0,

pub.1045917317,10.1080/00335639209384009,The politics of the nuclear text: Reading Robert Oppenheimer's letters and recollections,"Nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war are daunting “facts” of contemporary culture. Nonetheless, they are symbolic productions: the meaning of the Bomb historically has been created in a cultural dialogue between conflicting interests. This essay uses post‐structuralist theory to explore the utility of a key signifier in that dialogue, the scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer. During the 1980s, critics interpreted a published volume of Oppenheimer's letters in ways that both clarified and challenged the conventional arrangements of nuclear deterrence. Their responses suggest the enduring value of Oppenheimer as an intertextual form that mediates cultural experience of nuclear weapons.",Quarterly Journal of Speech,1992,78,4,429-449,"Taylor, Bryan C.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045917317,11,"[Mckerrow, Raymie E.]|[ur.016441652467.93]|Communication Monographs|1989|56|2|91-111|10.1080/03637758909390253|pub.1001425853|375;[Fiske, John]|[ur.011210723607.28]|Critical Studies in Media Communication|1986|3|4|391-408|10.1080/15295038609366672|pub.1001965703|220;[Aune, James Arnt]|[ur.016410664741.81]|Southern Speech Communication Journal|1983|48|3|255-268|10.1080/10417948309372569|pub.1003905090|5;[Schiappa, Edward]|[]|Communication Monographs|1989|56|3|253-272|10.1080/03637758909390263|pub.1004568276|31;[Goldzwig, Steve; Cheney, George]|[; ur.015252754077.76]|Communication Studies|1984|35|1|8-23|10.1080/10510978409368156|pub.1006296193|15;[Foss, Karen A.; Littlejohn, Stephen W.]|[; ]|Critical Studies in Media Communication|1986|3|3|317-336|10.1080/15295038609366657|pub.1014452857|20;[Wander, Philip]|[]|Communication Studies|1983|34|1|1-18|10.1080/10510978309368110|pub.1014713325|132;[Blair, Carole]|[ur.014517354147.23]|Western Journal of Communication|1987|51|4|364-383|10.1080/10570318709374279|pub.1014744404|13;[Goodnight, G.

Neither our institutions nor our ways of thinking about national strategy have kept pace with the stunning changes of recent history. Failure to recognize the profound effects of nearly a half‐century of bipolar confrontation has yielded many anachronisms and unresolved ambiguities in our national security strategies. Our instruments of statecraft continue to be influenced, if not guided, by obsolete paradigms and outmoded institutions that are wasteful and counterproductive. These cold war legacies prevent us from effectively managing change and from taking advantage of the unique opportunities offered by the evolving new world order. They particularly threaten to arrest the development of new relations with our former antagonists of the bipolar world order.New ways of structuring our foreign relations and, particularly, our defense establishment must be found. The very concept of national security must be redefined, particularly its element of strategic nuclear deterrence. New roles and missions for our military forces are particularly needed, if they are to remain relevant and capable in a world that can no longer afford, but still requires, instruments of military power. Most importantly, we must find the leadership to formulate and articulate a new vision of America's role in the new world order.",Comparative Strategy,1992,11,4,357-372,"Keel, Earl E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019528260,1,"[George, Alexander L.]|[]|Survival|1984|26|5|223-234|10.1080/00396338408442197|pub.1004744670|26;[Huntington, Samuel P.]|[]|Survival|1991|33|1|3-17|10.1080/00396339108442570|pub.1010783382|59;[Deibel, Terry L.]|[ur.011027406566.72]|Foreign Policy|1991||84|3|10.2307/1148778|pub.1102458456|9;[Gergen, David]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1991|71|1|1|10.2307/20045107|pub.1102764256|1"

pub.1115101065,10.11375/kokusaiseiji1957.100_1,The Cold War and After: An Introduction,"To commemorate the 100th issue of International Relations, the editorial board decided to compile a special volume on the Cold War and After: Japanese Perspectives. The 14 articles contained in this volume are for the sake of convenience divided into three groups: theory, history and prospects. The article by Yoshinobu Yamamoto gives an overview of the evolutions of international relations theories during the past four decades which, he argues, can be related to the historical developments of international relations in the real world. Since the latter were to an important degree shaped by the Cold War, a dominant paradigm altered from time to time, reflecting the sequence of events in the East-West relations. After tracing the paradigmatic development from the intitial stage of realist domination through the rise of various versions of liberalism during the 1970's to the resurgence of neo-realism in the more recent times, Yamamoto forsees the coming of an age of liberalist-led integration of international theories following the end of the Cold War. This basically sanguine prospect shown by Yamamoto is in line with one of the major theses dealt with by various writers who contributed to this volume. Influenced by John Gaddis' book The Long Peace, they are concerned with the reasons for the continuation of peace between the two superpowers during the Cold War era. Without necessarily denying the idea that such systemic and objective factors as bipolarity and nuclear deterrence were conducive to the long peace, some of the writers for this volume rather emphasized the learning capacity of the policy-makers of the both superpowers as an explanatory factor (Anami, Umemoto and Ishii). To some if not all, the long peace in the Cold War era was part of the longer trend in international relations, i. e. the trend towards no war among the major powers. The lessons of the two World Wars in the 20th century brought about attitudinal change regardiag the issue of war and peace, signs of which were discernible even in the behaviours of the Soviet and American leaders despite their Cold War rhetoric. Democracy is not necessarily regarded as a prerequisite for international peace. In fact, examining the thought of George Kennan on the problems of democracy, one of the contributors (Terachi) casts doubts on the thesis that democracy is by nature conducive to international peace. If one takes a narrow definition of the Cold War with a focus on Soviet-American relations or East-West relations in Europe, the long peace thesis seems largely acceptable, although his or her explanation may differ from the one offered in the above. A more fundamental objection will be raised, however, by those who adhere to the idea that the ‘hot wars’ outside Europe were the essential ingredient of the Cold War. In fact this was the central theme of The Origins of the Cold War in Asia, a volume edited by Yonosuke Nagai and Akira Iriye fifteen years ago. Wit-nessed two hot wars in Korea and Indochina during their life time, many contemporary Japanese (and probably other Asian) historians would choose this broader definition of the Cold War. This thesis is worth remebering, although, apart from a brief reference by Ishii, it was not fully discussed in the present volume. This is so particularly because the relative weight of the Cold War in the entire history of the post WW II era differs from one region to another. Hece the difference in the impact of the end of the Cold War upon the regional international affairs in the years to come, which is the topic of the the third section of the present volume. Koizumi (who deals with the present and future in the latter half of her article) and Ueta are concered with post-Cold War Europe, whereas all others are either with Asia/Pacific (Sakanaka, Kurata, Tamaki, Hara and Purrington) or with more broad themes (Oizumi and Takehiko Yamamoto).",International Relations,1992,1992,100,"1-15,l5","WATANABE, Akio",University of Tokyo,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115101065,0,
pub.1000883194,10.1080/03050629208434791,"A “new world order”: From balancing to hegemony, concert or collective security?∗","This paper will consider the suitability of three theoretical perspectives on the international order (balance of power, hegemonic stability, and international society) to the “new world order” emerging in the aftermath of the Cold War and the Gulf War. This will be done by deriving five conflict‐management mechanisms from the logic of the three perspectives and then examining their application to the postwar and the post‐Cold War eras. My argument will be that recent changes in world politics have affected the relative utility of these conflict‐management devices. Balancing and nuclear deterrence, closely related to the logic of the balance of power school, were the major instruments for maintaining the international order during the postwar era. They might be still relevant for certain purposes but three other mechanisms could become increasingly effective in the post‐postwar era. Each of these three arrangements, however, suits a somewhat different setting. U.S. leadership, closely associated with the hegemonic stability perspective, could play a major role in managing major military crises.

But it has not been so dramatically altered as to eliminate the Russian need for a nuclear deterrent or to justify completely ignoring them as potential competitors on the world stage. The nuclear stalemate which characterized relations with the former Soviet Union has been replaced with an unpredictability which presents both danger and promise, prompting the question, 'where do we go from here?' The alternatives of defense dominance, U. S. nuclear superiority, or nuclear disarmament/near-disarmament have all been suggested as possible replacements to the strategy of deterrence through assured destruction. A closer examination of these proposed strategies finds that all have the potential to leave us less secure than we might have otherwise believed. Before we try to escape from the mutual balance of terror which has dominated most of the nuclear age, we should have a firm idea of where the strategy will lead. This includes taking into consideration the legitimate security concerns of Russia and the other commonwealth states.",,1992,,,,"Knowles, Stephen V.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091590002,0,
pub.1091586308,10.21236/ada251476,Deterrence and Conventional Military Forces,"The search for national security strategy periodically opens major policy debates that push us in new, sometimes revolutionary directions. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war have reopened a national debate unmatched since the end of World War II. Dramatic changes in the international system have forced us to reevaluate old strategies and look for new focal points amidst the still unsettled debris of the bipolar world. At issue is America's role in a new world order and our capabilities to defend and promote our national interests in a new environment where threats are both diffuse and uncertain, where conflict is inherent, yet unpredictable. The degree of uncertainty requires flexibility in our military strategy and significant departures from cold war concepts of deterrence. This study examines new options for deterrence. Its primary thesis is that new conditions in both the international and domestic environments require a dramatic shift from a nuclear to a conventional force dominant deterrent. The study identifies the theories and strategies of nuclear deterrence that transfer to modern conventional forces in a multipolar world.",,1992,,,,"Guertner, Gary L.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091586308,1,

However, the opponent in the Gulf War was Iraq, a heavily armed Third World state with an aggressive nuclear weapons program, not the Soviet Union. By the end of 1991, the Soviet Union had disintegrated; and the Cold War abruptly ended. These stunning events precipitated an intense review of a United States' national security strategy and military force structure overwhelmingly based on containing communism and nuclear deterrence. As demonstrated during the Gulf War, advanced military technology plays an important role in both our strategy and current force structure. The war also underscored the need to address the growing proliferation of weapons technology in the Third World. In March 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney highlighted the technology issue in stating ""we are on the verge of a revolutionary period in military technology, with leading nations achieving major breakthroughs and smaller nations gathering access to weapons of mass destruction.? This paper will focus on the current role of technology in US strategy technology issues from the Gulf War, and future military technology challenges for the United States.",,1992,,,,"Elliott, Carol",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091567228,0,

Historically the SLBM leg has depended upon the ICBM to provide the promptness and destructive capability essential to this nation's strategic nuclear deterrence policy. The deployment of the Trident II (D-5) missile eliminates this dependence. This latest SLBM provides the promptness and the destructive capability to enable it to assume the operational role previously fulfilled by the ICBM force. This paper will examine the roles of our nation's nuclear forces in support of the strategic nuclear deterrent policy. It will briefly describe the characteristics of each leg of the triad. It will discuss the operational improvements to the SLBM force which enable it to assume the role of the ICBM in nuclear deterrence. Then, some additional operational improvements will be addressed to further emphasize the enhanced characteristics of the SLBM force. Finally, a few concerns over the SLBM assuming the role of the ICBM will be discussed. As a result of these operational improvements it can be concluded the SLBM can assume the role of the ICBM.",,1992,,,,"Whitehead, Craig C.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091612154,0,
pub.1063845884,10.1177/073889429201200102,Nuclear Deterrence Theory: The Record of Aggregate Testing and An Alternative Research Agenda,"One of the most controversial subjects among students of international politics is the role of rational choice in deterrence. Disagreement is especially intense regarding application to the nuclear setting. Progress in that debate depends on identifying evidence appropriate for testing a wide range of propositions. The overall purpose of this review is to assess the record of aggregate evaluation in order to obtain guidance for further research. This investigation unfolds in several stages.

The factors behind this peace may have to do with the combination of long-term fluctuations that produces alternate crises and `ages', and with a particular way of seeing that is as characteristic of the present period as what we now perceive as `Victorian' was for the period between the Congress of Vienna and World War I.

Much depends on the Soviet Union’s attitude towards nuclear deterrence. Recent developments suggest that a fundamental revision of the USSR’s military doctrine and strategic force posture is in the making. While the postulates of ‘defensive orientation’ and ‘reasonable sufficiency’ so far have been applied almost exclusively to conventional forces, Soviet defence experts have begun to discuss their implications for strategic nuclear forces and the concepts of deterrence, parity and stability. This analysis focuses on the evolution of this debate since 1989.1 Five schools of thought can be distinguished: In line with Gorbachev’s Programme for a Nuclear Free World by the Year 2000, the abolitionists reject both nuclear deterrence and military-strategic parity as foundations for security and stability, advocate the transition to a nuclear-free world; and propose the prevention of war through political means.The moderates assume that nuclear weapons will form part of strategic reality for a prolonged period; suggest a broad interpretation of sufficiency; define specific force criteria for strategic stability (minimum deterrence); advocate asymmetrical responses and unilateral adjustments on the side of the USSR; and propose a negotiated, radical reduction of strategic forces.The unilateralists focus on minimal force requirements for an assured retaliatory capability; advocate unilateral cuts of Soviet nuclear forces; and propose the transition to a French-type minimum deterrence posture.The pacifists are part of the growing anti-nuclear constituency in the USSR, consider nuclear forces as symbols of Soviet imperial power and as a serious hazard to the environment; and advocate immediate denuclearisation at the local level.The conservatives equate sufficiency with strict parity in forces, insist that the Soviet Union has to ‘keep its powder dry’, yet concede that current force levels could be lowered substantially on a reciprocal basis.

Their respective arsenals have never exceeded a very small fraction of the USSR’s and the United States’ strategic forces; Britain’s and France’s rationales for having nuclear weapons have been based on criteria tailored specifically for medium nuclear powers. Moreover, in sharp contrast with both superpowers, the development costs of the French and British nuclear forces have been very high, penalizing conventional forces in the case of France and leading to a growing dependence on the United States in the case of the United Kingdom (UK). Finally, although Paris and London have been able to draw advantages from the possession of nuclear forces, they have never been in a position to offer an explicit nuclear guarantee to their European allies, thus leaving the United States as the sole provider of extended deterrence within the framework of the integrated military structure of the Atlantic alliance.",Nuclear Weapons in the Changing World,1992,,,111-126,"Boyer, Yves",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013714782,0,

The function of the counterforce strategies I model is not to enable a state confidently to launch a nuclear attack but to convince its adversary that the probability that it might do so as a last resort is greater than zero. The models allow one to investigate rational behavior when information is incomplete and there is an incentive to strike first, and therefore provide a way to explore controversies about the effect of counterforce strategies on both the credibility of extended deterrence and the possibility of inadvertent nuclear war. The models suggest, contrary to the claims of a number of writers, that the use of nuclear counterforce strategies is not necessarily inconsistent with rational behavior and provide some insight into the relation between counterforce strategies and brinkmanship models of deterrence.",American Political Science Review,1991,85,3,727-749,"Wagner, R.

Burden sharing and decision making will become more challenging alliance problems in an increasingly multipolar and fluid international context. Five factors deserve particular attention, especially with regard to the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization: the conduct and aftermath of the Persian Gulf war; German political and security choices; West European political and economic integration; the internal evolution of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; and intra-Western political differences. During a time of unpredictable flux in international politics, the most prudent course for the United States is to retain the alliance ties established and maintained at great cost in the past and to adapt them to new requirements.",The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1991,517,1,80-93,"YOST, DAVID S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012323994,0,"[Yost, David S.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1990|69|5|107|10.2307/20044604|pub.1102757218|11"
pub.1012406788,10.1017/cbo9780511625039.012,Nuclear hostages,"Most of us believe that terrorists act wrongly when they seize civilian hostages to enforce political demands or otherwise advance their political programs. At the same time, many of us believe that nuclear deterrence is morally permissible, or at least would be if that policy were carried out in the right way. There is an apparent inconsistency lurking here. For as has been frequently pointed out since early in the nuclear age, when nation A practices nuclear deterrence against nation B, A – in effect – holds a large fraction of B's civilian population hostage to the good behavior of B's government. As Thomas Schelling aptly puts it, “The ‘balance of terror’ … is simply a massive and modern version of an ancient institution: the exchange of hostages.” This view of the balance of terror immediately suggests an argument against the moral permissibility of any form of nuclear deterrence that threatens retaliation against civilians. This argument – the nuclear hostages argument – is a deontological argument; that is, it condemns nuclear deterrence not because of its consequences, but on the basis of morally objectionable features inherent in the policy itself (or the acts required to implement it). More specifically, the nuclear hostages argument says nuclear deterrence is wrong because, as a form of political hostage taking, it shares the features that make terrorist hostage taking morally wrong. My aims in this essay are two. First, I argue that there is no genuine inconsistency in our beliefs about nuclear deterrence and terrorists' holding people hostage.","Violence, Terrorism, and Justice",1991,,,276-295,"Kavka, Gregory S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012406788,1,

A critical approach to the campaign “in the pragmatic attitude” reveals that the campaign really was the site of several competing texts, including mass‐media narratives and pacifist social movement discourse resisting civil defense. The public debate over civil defense programs reveals cultural contradictions between some of these texts and the practices of everyday life, especially the tension between competitive individualism and cooperative community.",Western Journal of Communication,1991,55,2,105-133,"Mechling, Elizabeth Walker; Mechling, Jay",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040777153,25,"[Katriel, Tamar; Philipsen, Gerry]|[ur.07712461624.07; ur.010265100613.30]|Communication Monographs|1981|48|4|301-317|10.1080/03637758109376064|pub.1004878074|169;[Leff, Michael; Sachs, Andrew]|[; ]|Western Journal of Communication|1990|54|3|252-273|10.1080/10570319009374342|pub.1012181989|59;[Ivie, Robert L.]|[ur.011603426447.39]|Communication Monographs|1987|54|2|165-182|10.1080/03637758709390224|pub.1017643597|80;[WOOLARD, KATHRYN A.]|[]|American Ethnologist|1989|16|2|268-278|10.1525/ae.1989.16.2.02a00050|pub.1022359855|57;[Medhurst, Martin J.]|[ur.012013362375.22]|Communication Monographs|1987|54|2|204-220|10.1080/03637758709390226|pub.1023136731|15;[Kung, Mei-Ping; Chumpradit, Sumalee; Billings, Jeffrey; Kung, Hank]|[ur.01145435671.41; ur.01140373507.89; ur.0661402554.31; ur.0615735606.55]|Life Sciences|1992|51|2|95-106|10.1016/0024-3205(92)90002-7|pub.1026386574|14;[Horne, Janet]|[]|Western Journal of Communication|1989|53|3|247-259|10.1080/10570318909374305|pub.1029085097|8;[Carlson, A.

I will use the approved National War College Framework for Military Strategy as a tool for examining the political objectives of our nuclear deterrent policy, the military objectives that will support those political objectives in the outyears, and the capabilities and vulnerabilities of both superpower arsenals. Finally, I will define the force structure required by the strategic plan to accomplish our objectives and discuss the potential results. Before looking at the political objectives of our deterrent policy, I feel it appropriate to point out the curious aspects of discussing a military strategy that depends for its success on never being proven out. In many cases, the successful application of a military strategy requires hostilities to exist -- the military strategy of the Allied Powers to defeat the Axis Powers in World War If being a case in point -- and involves the use of force to cause the enemy to do something he would not otherwise want to do. Judging our nuclear deterrent strategy of the past four decades as successful implies that the Soviets would have initiated a nuclear war had our strategic forces not existed. This is an implication that absolutely cannot be proven to be true, yet it is the very basis of our stated need for a triad of forces capable of devastating the Soviet Union. Whatever future strategy the United States pursues to deter a major nuclear war with the Soviets, it will only be successful if such a war does not occur. Therefore the strategy must be one of war prevention. This does not mean, however, that we should concentrate on cost issues and ignore the warfighting capabilities of these forces. Rather, we must field affordable forces that guarantee a great amount of credible retaliatory capability regardless of the mode of attack the Soviets choose.",,1991,,,,"Roszak, Richard S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091564277,0,

Kegley advocates Kennan's argument that the “inevitable triumph of Western liberalism” was certain and the failure of the communist regime was predetermined by its insulation.

However, mass public acceptance of nuclear deterrence policies does not seem to have eroded significantly, except in West Germany. On the other hand, some delegitimization of nuclear deterrence has emerged in important sectors of the elite and attentive publics in Britain, West Germany, and the United States. Future public support for nuclear deterrence will probably be influenced by factors both outside and within the North Atlantic community, but the choices made by Western leadership elites will be of crucial significance in dealing with the elite-mass public gap on some issues (e.g., firstuse policies) and the trends that have tended to delegitimize nuclear deterrence in some sectors of the elite and attentive publics.",Armed Forces & Society,1990,16,4,487-508,"Yost, David S.",Naval Postgraduate School,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063730263,6,

As far as Catholicism is concerned, recent popes, some Episcopal conferences, and Vatican II Council have all given much attention to this issue. In this paper, the focus is on the teachings of the current pope, John Paul II, because the pope is a central figure in Catholicism and because John Paul II has made a particularly important contribution in this area. The paper summarizes John Paul II's ideas concerning war and peace, the just war and nuclear deterrence, and indicates some of the changes that have occurred over the years in his teachings. The paper concludes that, in spite of the fact that popes are often criticized because of their conservatism or their lack of courage and realism, their teachings on peace seem to have become increasingly significant and attuned to the needs of contemporary society.",Social Compass,1990,37,2,199-205,"VAILLANCOURT, Jean-Guy",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063686730,0,

At the root of this situation are the interventionist attitudes and policies of successive federal governments which for more than four decades have distorted the investment decision and, in more recent times, discouraged investment. Initially, uranium policy was determined by its strategic value and Australia's commitment to the nuclear deterrence philosophy. Later on, in a complete reversal, the morality of Australia's participation in the nuclear fuel cycle has been intensely debated. The end result has been a misallocation of resources and an uncertain outlook for the industry. If the past is a guide to the future, Australia may not develop its full uranium potential before the end of the century, if ever.",Resources Policy,1990,16,1,3-21,"Sorentino, Carlos M.R.",Macquarie University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038961776,1,"[Owen, A.D.]|[]|Energy Policy|1988|16|2|131-151|10.1016/0301-4215(88)90121-8|pub.1014358784|3;[Donn, Clifford B.; Roddewig, Richard J.]|[ur.011760701557.35; ]|ILR Review|1979|32|3|416|10.2307/2522281|pub.1069968631|8;[Ghosh, S.

Bearing in mind the limitations of evidence (e.g., the historical record of arms control behavior is extensive, while it is nonexistent on the subject of whether or not a nuclear war would, or even could, be controlled), this article reviews the entire field of nuclear strategy in order to identify that which appears to be false, the sources of error, that which appears to be true, and major propositions whose merit is arguable. The article finds it is false to claim that nuclear deterrence is existential, that nuclear strategy is irrelevant to weapon choice and force size, or that nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy are “essentially irrelevant to international security.” Seven common sources of error behind arguments on nuclear strategy are discussed—these include the relative neglect of politics, psychology, history, and culture, and of differences among peacetime, crisistime, and wartime. The article finds that the prenuclear world is lost beyond retrieval, that there has to be nuclear strategy, that provision for the control of nuclear use is essential, that nuclear weapons are not instruments of military decision, and that nuclear deterrence has to be extended beyond the U.S. homeland. Finally, it is found that there is no generally persuasive case for or against the utility of active defenses, the value of arms control, or the importance of choosing one, rather than another, nuclear strategy.",Comparative Strategy,1990,9,1,1-32,"Gray, Colin S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025508983,1,"[Ranger, Robin]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|1987|10|3|47-58|10.1080/01636608709477601|pub.1009664136|1;[Buzan, Barry]|[]||1987||||10.1007/978-1-349-18796-6|pub.1017076046|69;[Fairbanks, Charles H.; Shulsky, Abram N.]|[; ur.016051730227.48]|The Washington Quarterly|1987|10|3|59-73|10.1080/01636608709477602|pub.1017631323|2;[Luttwak, Edward N.]|[]|The Washington Quarterly|1988|11|1|5-15|10.1080/01636608809477690|pub.1025138124|12;[Sagan, Scott D.]|[]|International Security|1985|9|4|99|10.2307/2538543|pub.1069980245|36;[Welch, David A.; Blight, James G.]|[; ]|International Security|1987|12|3|5|10.2307/2538800|pub.1069980462|22;[Bundy, McGeorge; Blight, James G.]|[ur.014550420323.30; ]|International Security|1987|12|3|30|10.2307/2538801|pub.1069980463|18;[Freedman, Lawrence; Halperin, Morton H.; McNamara, Robert]|[; ; ]|International Security|1988|13|1|177|10.2307/2538900|pub.1069980542|23;[Mueller, John]|[]|International Security|1988|13|2|55|10.2307/2538971|pub.1069980600|85;[Jervis, Robert]|[]|International Security|1988|13|2|80|10.2307/2538972|pub.1069980601|40;[Bundy, McGeorge]|[ur.014550420323.30]|International Security|1978|3|3|5|10.2307/2626716|pub.1070041569|3;[Rosenberg, David Alan]|[]|International Security|1983|7|4|3|10.2307/2626731|pub.1070041581|126;[Steinbruner, John D.]|[]|Foreign Policy|1981||45|16|10.2307/1148307|pub.1102456922|34;[Bundy, McGeorge]|[ur.014550420323.30]|Foreign Affairs|1969|48|1|1|10.2307/20039419|pub.1102752748|33;[Adelman, Kenneth L.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1984|63|2|240|10.2307/20042181|pub.1102754937|18;[Wohlstetter, Albert]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1985|63|5|962|10.2307/20042364|pub.1102755131|9;[Schelling, Thomas C.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1985|64|2|219|10.2307/20042570|pub.1102755267|44;[Lambeth, Benjamin; Lewis, Kevin]|[; ]|Foreign Affairs|1988|66|4|755|10.2307/20043481|pub.1102756023|5;[McFarlane, Robert C.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1988|67|1|33|10.2307/20043673|pub.1102756211|4;[Odom, William E.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1988|67|2|114|10.2307/20043776|pub.1102756325|4"

For some 150 years those who have sought to understand war have turned to Clausewitz—to find inspiration or to condemn him, to borrow or to steal from him, to quote or to misquote him.

If there has been a “nuclear revolution,” both the meaning of that term and its precise implications for the behavior of states remain unclear. This article agrees with the realist argument that the discovery of nuclear weapons did not by itself fundamentally change the structure of the international system. However, it argues that the subsequent condition of nuclear deterrence, resulting from the widespread deployment of nuclear weapons and sophisticated delivery systems during the 1960s, does constitute a source of structural change. Under nuclear deterrence, the superpowers have acquired a new function—“joint custodianship” of the system—which differentiates their role from that of other states. This suggests that the international system has a new organizing principle that varies from the standard realist conception of anarchy. Structural change led to the rise of detente in the 1970s; but because the processes by which leaders in Washington and Moscow adjusted to structural change were not always parallel, this detente was limited in scope and could not be sustained. As processes of adjustment begin to converge, the modified structural approach proposed in this article predicts that superpower cooperation in a new detente of the 1990s will go beyond what was achieved in the 1970s and also beyond what would be consistent with standard realist arguments.",International Organization,1990,44,1,55-82,"Weber, Steve",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030004283,23,"[Gourevitch, Peter]|[ur.014524122277.47]|International Organization|1978|32|4|881-912|10.1017/s002081830003201x|pub.1013775085|661;[Brezhnev, L.

pub.1017835278,10.1017/cbo9780511625145.005,Finite counterforce,"INTRODUCTION When theoreticians like ourselves think about nuclear deterrence, often we focus on a nasty choice between two rival package deals. The two have gone by various names over the years, but let me take the paired epithets: It's MAD versus NUTS. Each package is a bundle of policies: centrally, policies for the procurement of strategic nuclear forces, conditional intentions about how to use those forces in case of war, war plans, declaratory policy. Each package also carries implications about military research and development, arms control, conventional preparedness, relations with our allies, and foreign policy generally. In a debate between MAD and NUTS, each side may say that the other's policies involve a twofold risk: a grave moral risk of committing massacres and a grave prudential risk of inviting and undergoing like massacres.2 If they say so, they are right: Both MAD and NUTS are morally questionable, to put it mildly, and imprudent as well. (Imprudence is itself immoral, if it is the imprudence of a statesman who bungles the task of protecting his countrymen.) The contest between these two repugnant alternatives gives nuclear deterrence itself a bad name, and winds up making a strong case for a third package deal: nuclear pacifism, renunciation of all the risks and all the benefits of nuclear deterrence. Of course this third package carries its own grave moral and prudential risks. No alternative looks good. How does the very idea of nuclear deterrence turn into the nasty choice between MAD and NUTS? Does it have to happen? Is there no way around it? It happened for a reason, to be sure.",Nuclear Deterrence and Moral Restraint,1989,,,51-114,"Lewis, David",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017835278,4,
pub.1051433418,10.1017/cbo9780511625145.006,Deterrence and the moral use of nuclear weapons,"A fundamental underlying assumption of America's nuclear deterrence doctrine throughout its evolution over the past forty years is that deterrence is a function of both capability and resolve. For nuclear deterrence to work, it is held, the United States must not only have the capability to make nuclear warfare “a totally unacceptable and unrewarding proposition for the Soviet leadership”: U.S. leaders must also be perceived as willing to inflict unacceptable nuclear destruction on the Soviet Union in response to a Soviet nuclear attack on the United States or its allies. This assumption about the critical role of resolve in deterrence lies behind the concern for “credible” response options so prevalent in U.S. strategic nuclear doctrine and was a major motivating factor in the development of America's “countervailing” nuclear warfighting strategy, adopted in 1979 and reaffirmed by the Reagan Administration. The familiar logic of the countervailing strategy is that for deterrence to work the United States needs, first of all, the capability to destroy “those assets which are essential to Soviet warmaking capability and political control” (such as strategic and general-purpose forces, hardened command and control centers, and leadership cadres) because this is what Soviet leaders value most – not the general Soviet population and civilian economy. But, to make nuclear threats credible, the United States also needs the capability to minimize damage in a nuclear war to itself and its allies primarily through options for limited, controlled counter–military/political attacks (“to defeat Soviet military objectives without necessarily triggering a massive nuclear exchange”) but also through civil defenses (to provide some limited protection for the U.S. population).",Nuclear Deterrence and Moral Restraint,1989,,,115-162,"Foelber, Robert E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051433418,0,
pub.1016871600,10.1017/cbo9780511625145.007,Escaping from the bomb: immoral deterrence and the problem of extrication,"Objections to nuclear deterrence have been around almost as long as the Bomb itself. Broadly, and too crudely, they take two forms. On the one hand the policy (or mix of policies) is criticized in terms of its pragmatic framework – it is too costly, it is too dangerous, it doesn't deter enough (witness Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Vietnam, Afghanistan, etc.), its empirical assumptions (e.g. about the degree of the enemy's malevolence) are false. On the other hand the policy is rejected on the ground that the particular kind of threatening attitude it embodies violates deep moral constraints on how anyone should act or set himself to act. These constraints operate even, indeed especially, when the agent has good ends in view, and this is worth remembering since defenders of deterrence are naturally quick to stress the good they hope to achieve. It should also be noted that both lines of criticism usually involve moral concerns, since those who, for instance, object to the cost or risk of deterrence are not merely concerned for their own pockets or hides. More generally, some concern for avoiding harmful consequences and seeking beneficial ones clearly has a place in morality, though it must be insisted that it is not the whole of it. I have spoken of constraints, and it is natural to do so since the area of morality I have in mind often comes into play by way of restricting our choice of programs, techniques, or means to achieving what we see as worthwhile objectives.",Nuclear Deterrence and Moral Restraint,1989,,,163-226,"Coady, C.

pub.1002935860,10.1017/cbo9780511625145.010,Defending Europe: toward a stable conventional deterrent,"INTRODUCTION This contribution does not discuss details of nuclear policy. It accepts arguments advocating the conversion of the West's current nuclear forces into a minimum deterrent: The idea of controllable nuclear warfighting options has to be regarded as illusory because of the simple fact that the adversary's reactions are in principle incalculable. The call for a radically restricted role for nuclear forces appears to be very plausible, and consequently a “No First Use” policy should be adopted as a first step toward the broader goal of substantially reducing nuclear firepower. According to this line of argument, the resulting minimum deterrent should enhance crisis stability by not provoking the adversary (through threats to decapitate him) and by not providing him with lucrative targets (which, given today's state of the art, would suggest sea-basing). Within this context the concept of “finite deterrence” can be seen as a convincingly pragmatic step in the right direction. The INF Treaty and the commitment of the United States and the Soviet Union to START give rise to the hope that the two dominating military powers are already on the right track. As the role of nuclear deterrence is played down, the question arises what a complementary conventional defense would look like. This conventional posture, of course, should in itself be a strong deterrent and should minimize damage (e.g. the risk of escalation) if deterrence fails. The long-term sustainability of such a defense is a third and equally important requirement.",Nuclear Deterrence and Moral Restraint,1989,,,293-342,"Unterseher, Lutz",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002935860,1,
pub.1031926756,10.1017/cbo9780511625145.003,Introduction,"At least in the West nuclear “strategy” is in chaos. This is nothing new. Already in 1981 Lawrence Freedman had concluded his magisterial The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy: The position we have reached is one where stability depends on something that is more the antithesis of strategy than its apotheosis – on threats that things will get out of hand, that we might act irrationally, that possibly through inadvertence we could set in motion a process that in its development and conclusion would be beyond human control and comprehension. Others as different as Robert Jervis and Robert McNamara have continued to point out that, in McNamara's words, “The fact is, the Emperor has no clothes. Our present nuclear policy is bankrupt.” What is new is that we have now reached a historic juncture where the incoherence of the existing rationales for nuclear deterrence in general and for specific nuclear weapons systems in particular is more likely than ever to lead to mistaken policies that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and hundreds of millions of lives. The Soviet Union has agreed in the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty to asymmetrical reductions in nuclear weapons. It has also volunteered asymmetrical and unilateral reductions in conventional weapons and forces. The United States must decide, in the face of this, whether to spend tens of billions on the production of Stealth bombers and tens of billions on the development of strategic defenses and tens of billions on the development of a new small land-based missile and tens of billions on production of a new submarine-launched missile, among other weapons systems.",Nuclear Deterrence and Moral Restraint,1989,,,1-12,"Shue, Henry",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031926756,0,
pub.1029623562,10.1017/cbo9780511625145.008,The necessary moral hypocriy of the slide into mutual assured destruction,"The central moral paradox of nuclear deterrence theory is that peace (a morally very desirable good) is preserved by each superpower's immorally threatening the lives of millions of innocent people on the other side. The victims are people who would probably not have approved of the conventional aggression or nuclear surprise attack that began a war, but who must bear the brunt of the retaliation that turns the war into our worst nightmares of World War III. The prospective suffering of such innocents, the prospective destruction of the cities in which they live, presumably deters their leaders from ever beginning such wars in the first place, i.e. deters the prospectively guilty from becoming the guilty. Various proposals for alternatives to deterrence can be supported by practical arguments that they might actually improve the situation of Americans or others, as we balance all the contingencies against each other. Yet such proposals for disarmament, or for antimissile systems as in Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, or for a reliance on conventional defenses so as to limit nuclear weapons to deterring each other and nothing more (perhaps this is where the 1987 Reagan–Gorbachev INF Treaty is to take us?) all also stem in part from the moral problems of continuing to accept Mutual Assured Destruction. Preventing crime by punishing the loved ones of those who would have become criminals is certainly an alien and distasteful idea for anyone accustomed to the cultural traditions of the Western world. We cannot think of anything else for which we use such a bizarre mechanism, except the preservation of peace in the years after 1945.",Nuclear Deterrence and Moral Restraint,1989,,,227-270,"Quester, George H.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029623562,0,

Operating within the ideas offered by Johan Galtung in his research on transcendence of nuclear deterrence through transarmament, a plausible course of action is outlined. The process of transarmament would provide both superpowers with the means to escape their respective nuclear-dependent military doctrines. While this paper is only a thumbnail sketch of a paradigmatic shift from offensive to defensive national perceptions, its systemic orientation does suggest that transarmament is a possible future. It is a future whereby the US can increase world stability with little risk to its own legitimate national interests. The cost is in surrendering the role of world policeman. As a process of transcending offensive foreign policies, its strength lies in an increase in citizen participation and a total rejection of offensive strategies and weapon systems. The military will be structured to include both a Civil Defense (with a non-violent functional capability) and local militia (citizen soldiers). This deepening of policy-making will reinforce the other changes necessary for a defensively oriented and invulnerable country. The former is vital for the rest of the world and the latter is necessary for the self-interests of the US.",Journal of Peace Research,1989,26,3,307-317,"Fish, David S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054017620,0,"[Dankbaar, Ben]|[]|Emerging Technologies and Military Doctrine|1986|||127-140|10.1007/978-1-349-08505-7_11|pub.1053494934|2"

This essay extends the formal analysis of deterrence theory to the strategy of limited retaliation in which states exert coercive pressure by inflicting limited amounts of damage in order to make the threat of future punishment more credible. This strategy is modeled as a game of sequential bargaining with incomplete information.

pub.1115098064,10.11375/kokusaiseiji1957.90_1,An Overview of Nuclear Deterrence and Arms Control at a Turning Point,"Nuclear deterrence, the foundation of peace since the end of the Second World War, has now entered into a period of transition. As US-Soviet strategic nuclear forces reached “essential equivalence, ” the strategy of Assured Destruction began to be questioned. Doubts about the efficacy of this strategy produced the concept of a limited nuclear war strategy, as can be seen in the search for flexible options and the advocacy of “discriminate deterrence, ” and of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which emphasizes strategic defense. The US and the Soviet Union both continue their arms race, both in terms of quantity and quality. Yet, in December 1988, the two superpowers signed the treaty to abolish Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF). Furthermore, the US and the Soviet Union continue to negotiate to reduce their strategic forces by half. Both countries have place a brake on increasing their nuclear forces, and it is possible that they will be able to go a step further and reduce these arsenals. Arms control policy has also entered a period of transition. Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) was seen as a rational strategy in the 1960s. However, since the early 1970s, those responsible for US security policy began to entertain doubts regarding MAD. Moreover, the increase in Soviet military activism in the Third World only increased American suspicion. In 1974, the US Secretary for Defense, James Schlesinger, began to revise the MAD strategy, and since then, both the Carter and Reagan Administrations have subscribed to a “countervailing strategy, ” and have undertaken the modernization of American strategic nuclear forces. The Soviet Union, even after it achieved parity with the US, continued to increase its nuclear forces. However, based on General-Secretary Gorbachev's “reasonable sufficiency” concept, the Soviet are moving away from an “offense-oriented” strategy and toward a “defense-oriented” strategy. It would appear also that the Soviets are moving away from their strategy of fighting and winning a nuclear war. If the strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction can no longer be relied upon, what type of strategy will break the stalemate of nuclear deterrence? President Reagan has proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). However, many people have expressed their doubts about the technology, the cost, and the military strategy of SDI. Furthermore, confusion on Western strategy exists within the alliance. The Treaty to abolish INF has both surprised and confused the countries of NATO, which have relied on nuclear deterrence throughout the postwar period. Arguments exist in Europe for the modernization of nuclear forces as well as for the denuclearization of Europe, and the debate is very confused. Arguments about the future of nuclear strategy can be divided into three views. First, there is the view that a strategy based on MAD will be unavoidable in this century, and therefore we should return to MAD. The second view argues that MAD, based upon the murder of masses of people, is immoral, and therefore we should pursue and promote the SDI. And, a third view sees deterrence based on nuclear weapons as dangerous, and advocates a departure from nuclear deterrence. It is unclear which direction the US and the Soviet Union will choose in addressing strategic issues. What we need is deterrence against war. In the foreseeable future, it is unlikely that we will find an effective method of maintaining the peace other than nuclear deterrence. But, we need stable deterrence. The Western countries need to find a balance between an effective strategy and arms control. It is irresponsible to simply reduce nuclear forces without paying attention to strategic concerns. However, excessively increasing nuclear forces only provoke the other side, and it is destabilizing. What we need to do now is to construct a new conception of deterrence stability.",International Relations,1989,1989,90,"1-18,l5","SAKANAKA, Tomohisa",Aoyama Gakuin University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115098064,0,
pub.1115047908,10.11375/kokusaiseiji1957.90_91,Theoretical Examinations of Extended Nuclear Deterrence,"U. S. extended nuclear deterrence is understood to mean that the U. S. is committed to use nuclear weapons, and escalate to the strategic level if necessary, in the event of a major Soviet conventional and/or nuclear attack on its allies in Western Europe and the Far East. Extended nuclear deterrence continues to pose some of the most vexing problems of modern strategic policy. America's policy of extending nuclear deterrence to its allies can often conflict with the requirements of strategic stability vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. U. S. extended deterrent objectives might make the U. S. more prone to develop destabilizing counterforce damage-limiting capabilities for its central strategic nuclear forces in order to enhance the credibility of its overseas commitments. This policy would run counter to the concept of stability of U. S. -Soviet mutual deterrence. U. S. extended nuclear deterrence for Western Europe has one dominant aspect: the U. S. reserves the right to employ its NATO-based nuclear weapons early and first, and escalate to the strategic level if necessary, in the event of a major Soviet conventional attack on its West European allies. This posture has long been deemed essential since NATO's conventional strength has rarely seemed adequate to deter a full-scale Soviet conventional attack or to defend Western Europe effectively once war began. Because of this, in Europe, the conventional, U. S. non-strategic nuclear, and U. S. strategic nuclear coupling is a prominent component of NATO strategy and is regarded as cardinal to the credibility of extended nuclear deterrence. In sharp contrast to Western Europe, the function of conventional and nuclear coupling is not as relevant to the viability of the extension of the U. S. nuclear umbrella to Japan. This is because the status of conventional forces in Northeast Asia, naval and air forces confronting the U. S. S. R. in particular, has not been so adverse for the U. S. and Japan. Accordingly, the U. S. does not need to rely heavily on nuclear weapons to defend Japan. For this reason, U. S. extended nuclear deterrence to Japan has been, in essence, a U. S. retaliatory nuclear deterrent against a Soviet nuclear first use against Japan. Deterrence rests with the fear that the U. S. would use its nuclear weapons to respond to a Soviet nuclear threat or attack on Japan, which would risk escalation to a strategic nuclear exchange. A two-track policy is necessary for the maintenance of credible U. S. extended nuclear deterrence. One track is to implement measures to prevent an outbreak of nuclear war between the U. S. and the Soviet Union. The other track is to strengthen the ties between the U. S. and its allies in order to prevent the Soviets from misunderstanding the American nuclear commitment. For the first track, there are two broad policy dimensions: 1) the pursuit of a balanced policy between the maintenance of a credible U. S. nuclear deterrent power and stable U. S. -Soviet mutual deterrence, and 2) the maintenance of the regional conventional military balance vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. An important policy orientation for the first policy dimension should be a balanced deterrence, not simply deterrence by existential nuclear threat or by increased prompt counterforce. threats. The latter should complement the former, up to the point short of destabilizing the U. S. -Soviet mutual deterrence. For the second dimension, we must first recognize that if the Soviet Union employs its conventional forces against major U. S. allies under the condition of U. S. -Soviet mutual vulnerability, it is likely to be only when a quick conventional victory or fait accompli seems possible. Thus, it is crucial for U. S. allies, with the assistance of the United States, to maintain at least not too unfavorable immediate and short-term regional conventional military balance vis-à-vis the Soviet Union that would prevent the Soviets from perceiving",International Relations,1989,1989,90,"91-102,l12","OGAWA, Shinichi",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115047908,0,
pub.1115154422,10.11375/kokusaiseiji1957.90_19,A Study on the Incompatibility of Arms Control with Nuclear Deterrence: Western Security at a Crossroads,"The INF elimination Treaty signed by Reagan and Gorbachev on December 8, 1987 is a clear success in securing Soviet agreement to the NATO's arms control goals, such as the global zero of ‘deep cut’ and the intrusive verification measure of ‘on-site inspection, ’ which the SALT Treaties markedly failed to achieve in the 1970's. However, this Treaty has generated a good deal of confusion and unease in the West. The imbalance of conventional forces in Europe, which favors the Soviet Union, could become more dangerous if the West's nuclear deterrent is weakened. Radical nuclear arms reductions could be harmful to Western security. This article aims to clarify the central thesis of whether arms control can be compatible with nuclear deterrence and Western security. It is a thesis that even the most thoughtful arms control theorists have so far failed to analyze in the postwar period. First, any degree of denuclearization of Europe not tied to a redress of the Soviet conventional/chemical superiority will not make Europe safe for conventional/chemical warfare. At the same time, to implement the INF Treaty is to lose the only means of making a “Eurostrategic nuclear war (theater limited nuclear war in Europe), ” which could leave the USSR open to attack, but would give sanctuary to the USA, and which might dissuade most effectively the Soviet Union's decision of waging war upon NATO. Second, the INF Treaty serves to decouple the U. S. strategic deterrent from Europe's defense, and creates phychologically an atmosphere among the American people to support the withdrawal of the American troops from Europe. Third, it would become the first step on the ‘slippery slope’ to the denuclearization of Europe, which will lead to neutralization of Europe. This is one of the ultimate goals pursued by the Soviets. Movement towards denuclearization also undermines the important principle of sharing the nuclear burden and risks within Alliance. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the theoretical deficiency of arms control concepts, combined with related and false militico-strategic concepts, necessarily contradicts the end of national security and contributes to a worsening of the existing security situation. There are several reasons and causes. The marked false strategic doctrine formulates a nuclear deterrence rationale to prevent an all-out or accidental nuclear war with the Soviet Union, divorcing from its original and right objectives to deter the Soviets from starting to invade with any type of weapons. Another deficiency is derived from the official U. S. persistence in believing in the erroneous theory of ‘nuclear equilibrium at a lower level, ’ which decreases proportionally the gross amount of destruction by the projected nuclear weapons and therefore the credibility of nuclear deterrence. The U. S. has not awakened to the danger caused by a radical cut of their own ‘nuclear deterrent’ in pursuit of a weakening of the Soviet ‘nuclear counter-deterrent’. Especially, the U. S. does not recognize the geographical advantage of the central location in the Eurasian Continent which offers the Soviet state absolute safety and permits a multiplicity of applied pressures around the periphery. That is to say, the only retaliatory way to resist the unchangeable desire of the heartland power for the achievement of hegemony is to sustain a robust and superior nuclear capability, because only nuclear weapons can definitely give decisively destructive damages to the central or valuable part of the Soviet mainland.",International Relations,1989,1989,90,"19-32,l6","NAKAGAWA, Yatsuhiro",University of Tsukuba,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115154422,0,
pub.1115092138,10.11375/kokusaiseiji1957.90_33,Foreign Policy Theories of Deterrence Failures,"This essay reviews the renewed strategic debate, with a particular focusing on the issue of deterrence failure. If nuclear deterrence should fail, how will it fail and why? In other words, what are the obstacles to a successful deterrence strategy? It is theoretically impossible to prove or falsify the success of deterrence strategy as long as no aggressive action is taken by an adversary. Only when an aggressive action is taken do we know that the strategy is not working. Based on the various case studies conducted by Alexander L. George, John D. Steinbruner, Robert Jervis, and Richard Ned Lebow, part one of this paper discusses why and how deterrence failed in the past. The historical cases include the 1914 European crisis, the US-Japanese crisis prior to Pearl Harbor in 1941, and the Middle East conflict in 1973. Special attention is paid to the perceptual and psychological factors in the challenger's decision-making process. The evidence suggests that a deterrence strategy may be ineffective, risky, or, at worst, counter-productive under certain conditions. To avoid the tragedy of deterrence failure in the nuclear era, it is essential to maintain crisis stability so that no party has an incentive to launch a pre-emptive attack. Furthermore, it is argued that a strategy of deterrence must be supplemented by crisis prevention measures. The second part of this paper examines why some strategists believe that strategic stability is undermined. We trace the arguments of Fred Charles Iklé, Colin Gray, and others with critical eyes. We also compare the key logic of the strategies with concept of Mutual Assured Destruction and of Limited Nuclear Options. The last part of this essay examines which strategic concepts are valid for stable deterrence, and which concepts are invalid. Finally, we discuss the possibility of reassuring an adversary through the creation of “security regimes, ” as suggested by as Joseph S. Nye, Jr. and Alexander L.

The approach of the end of a decade traditionally provides an overwhelming temptation of this nature. There is an implicit assumption that with the change of calendar some kind of climacteric will be reached, and that policies which have been found perfectly satisfactory hitherto will suddenly require radical readjustment. It should therefore come as no surprise that the Royal United Services Institute selected as its main theme for the 1986–7 season of lectures the title ‘Conventional Deterrence: Into the 1990s’. The cynic might be tempted to enquire what is so likely to be new and different from deterrence in the 1980s: is there any point in reploughing this well-tilled field in pursuit of an ever diminishing crop of new ideas?",Conventional Deterrence into the 1990s,1989,,,3-6,"Boyd-Carpenter, Thomas",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023859452,0,

For one thing, without the complicating factor of alliances, strategy in the nuclear age would be a much simpler affair. Nuclear deterrence could indeed be minimal if it needed to cover no more than the territory deined by the national boundaries of each of the super-powers. The deployment or withdrawal of forces from overseas areas would be a matter of military expediency only, not one of profound political consequences.

It begins with an overview of the conceptual foundation of N(W)FZs and of their political and normative significance for our times. The essay then goes on to describe the content of the Rarotonga Treaty which established the SPNFZ, as well as the criticisms against it The essay uses an analytical framework in which notions like 'aspirations' and 'normativity' figure as key concepts, in order to ascertain the real problems with the zone The main questions asked here are: who aspired to what, at which level, and who or what hindered these aspirations? The analysis shows, on the one hand, that the framers of the SPNFZ were hedged in by certain constraints that they themselves could not overcome easily, like some rules of international law. On the other hand, it also demonstrates that the shortcomings of the SPNFZ are more deep-rooted, in the sense that the bedrock of the entire undertaking was a self-contradictory presumption, i. e. a nuclear-deterrence-based nuclear free zone. The essay thus draws the conclusion that the real weakness of the SPNFZ lies in this inherent contradiction, particularly when compared with New Zealand's endeavor to become nuclear-free.",Journal of Peace Research,1988,25,4,411-430,"Mogami, Toshiki",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053993351,2,"[Mediansky, F.A.]|[]|Australian Outlook|1985|39|2|77-83|10.1080/10357718508444876|pub.1001557482|3;[Ordonnaud, Georges]|[]|Politique étrangère|1987|52|1|35-46|10.3406/polit.1987.3643|pub.1003763391|1;[Fischer, Georges]|[]|Annuaire français de droit international|1985|31|1|23-57|10.3406/afdi.1985.2649|pub.1007103646|4;[Arkin, William M.]|[]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1987|43|3|6-7|10.1080/00963402.1987.11459499|pub.1009641762|1;[Salzman, Jason]|[]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1987|43|6|45-49|10.1080/00963402.1987.11459556|pub.1013562125|2;[Holst, Johan Jørgen]|[ur.07726200345.60]|Security Dialogue|1981|12|3|239-245|10.1177/096701068101200303|pub.1014591994|5;[McKinley, Michael]|[]|Australian Outlook|1985|39|3|133-138|10.1080/10357718508444886|pub.1015020095|2;[Clements, Kevin P.]|[ur.012110301452.52]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1987|43|2|32-34|10.1080/00963402.1987.11459486|pub.1017163409|1;[Arkin, William M.; Fieldhouse, Richard W.]|[; ]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1985|41|6|11-15|10.1080/00963402.1985.11455975|pub.1023755389|5;[Multan, Wojciech]|[ur.011452700766.29]|Security Dialogue|1985|16|4|375-385|10.1177/096701068501600407|pub.1025728878|1;[Clements, Kevin P.]|[ur.012110301452.52]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1987|43|6|41-44|10.1080/00963402.1987.11459555|pub.1029919540|2;[Fieldhouse, Richard]|[]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1987|43|7|19-23|10.1080/00963402.1987.11459566|pub.1030199017|1;[Mogami, Toshiki]|[]|Peace &amp Change|1987|12|3‐4|39-50|10.1111/j.1468-0130.1987.tb00103.x|pub.1031486782|2;[Fischer, Georges]|[]|Annuaire français de droit international|1984|30|1|187-207|10.3406/afdi.1984.2599|pub.1033187963|1;[Fry, Greg]|[]|Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|1985|41|6|16-20|10.1080/00963402.1985.11455976|pub.1033613083|3;[Goldblat, Jozef; Lodgaard, Sverre]|[ur.011443467231.27; ur.010350632105.21]|Security Dialogue|1980|11|2|118-123|10.1177/096701068001100205|pub.1042599030|2;[Meunier, Clément]|[]|Politique étrangère|1987|52|1|71-86|10.3406/polit.1987.3646|pub.1045583951|1;[Premdas, Ralph; Howard, Michael C.]|[; ]|Australian Outlook|1985|39|3|177-186|10.1080/10357718508444892|pub.1048381837|5;[Godement, François]|[]|Politique étrangère|1987|52|1|21-34|10.3406/polit.1987.3642|pub.1048780322|1;[]|[]|Security Dialogue|1982|13|3|189-199|10.1177/096701068201300306|pub.1049311576|1;[Graham, Kennedy]|[]|Alternatives Global Local Political|1987|12|2|217-242|10.1177/030437548701200204|pub.1051590758|6;[de Muralt, R.W.G.]|[]|Netherlands International Law Review|1985|32|01|78|10.1017/s0165070x00010627|pub.1054869130|3;[Kiste, Robert C.; Herr, R.

American hegemony was nuclear because strategic weapons were integral to alliance ideology, institutional integration, and force structures. In many ways, nuclear weapons became the military pnnciple around which regional security alliances were organized, just as capitalist production was the essence of economic hegemony. By the same token, he argues that allied elite consent is the key characteristic of a system of hegemomc nuclear alliances While the South Korean military is increasingly integrated with American nuclear strategy, the South Korean state has not publicly legitimated the strategy. To mimmize public opposition, the South Korean and American military have kept secret details of American nuclear forces in Korea. The United States especially values nuclear weapons in Korea for the message they send to the Japanese security elite, itself unable to overcome public opposition to ground-based nuclear weapons in Japan. Across the Pacific as well as in Korea, the hegemomc alliance ideology of nuclear deterrence is increasingly contradicted by the American strategy of nuclear war-fighting. As a result, American nuclear hegemony in the Pacific is vulnerable to counter-hegemonic challenges. In the short term, however, Korea is arguably the only place where an irreparable fracture could emerge in the American system of regional nuclear hegemony.",Journal of Peace Research,1988,25,4,351-364,"Hayes, Peter",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053903368,3,"[Cox, Robert W.]|[]|Millennium Journal of International Studies|1983|12|2|162-175|10.1177/03058298830120020701|pub.1011045413|486;[Cox, Robert W.]|[]|Millennium Journal of International Studies|1981|10|2|126-155|10.1177/03058298810100020501|pub.1020368990|1089;[Keal, Paul]|[]||1983||||10.1007/978-1-349-06224-9|pub.1024540036|40;[Bacevich, A.

The questionnaire consisted of two sets of SD Scales for the affective component of the attitudes toward the two peace issues, two sets of Belief Scales for the cognitive component, Activity Motivation Scales for the action tendency component, and Activity Experience Scale measuring the degree of involvement in the peace-making activities. Discriminant analysis were conducted in order to examine the relationship between attitude components, as motivators and inhibitors of activity, and actual peace-making activities. A great concern about peace issues, extremely negative attitudes toward nuclear weapons and rather positive sttitudes toward peace movement were found, which showed hidden sides of today's Japanese youth. On the other hand, interpersonally contradictory evaluations of nuclear deterrence and intrapersonally inconsistent evaluation of peace movement were found, which was supposed to reflect complicated state of Japanese peace movements. Results of discriminant analysis suggested some determinants of two types of peace-making activities, organized and individual ones. There was significant correlation between organized peace-making activities and hatred to nuclear weapons, affective component of attitude. Organized peace activities also storongly correlated with cognitive attitude toward the doctrine of nuclear deterrence. A contradictory relationship between active participation in organized peace movement and negative affective evaluation of peace activity was found. This strange relation must be reflection of the fact that the active participants had experienced a number of difficulties in the promotion of the actual peace movement in Japan. It was belief in urgency of occurrence of nuclear war, cognitive component, that determined individual activities fo peace.",心理科学,1988,12,1,11-29,"明宏, 杉田",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1116563959,0,

But even more significantly, Wade reflects on the deterrence of further nuclear war subsequent to the Nagasaki bombing, which has succeeded—so far. The author expresses obvious concern about the fragile nature of nuclear deterrence because so little deviation is allowed from prearranged contingency plans.

pub.1039324793,10.1007/bf00869588,National security games,"Issues that arise in using game theory to model national security problems are discussed, including positing nation-states as players, assuming that their decision makers act rationally and possess complete information, and modeling certain conflicts as two-person games. A generic two-person game called the Conflict Game, which captures strategic features of such variable-sum games as Chicken and Prisoners' Dilemma, is then analyzed. Unlike these classical games, however, the Conflict Game is a two-stage game in which each player can threaten to retaliate — and carry out this threat in the second stage — if its opponent chose noncooperation in the first stage. Conditions for the existence of different pure-strategy Nash equilibria, or stable outcomes, are found, and these results are extended to situations in which the players can select mixed strategies (i.e., make probabilistic threats or choices). Although the Conflict Game sheds light on the rational foundations underlying arms races, nuclear deterrence, and other strategic situations, more detailed assumptions are required to tie this generic game to specific conflicts.",Synthese,1988,76,2,185-200,"Brams, Steven J.; Marc Kilgour, D.",New York University; Wilfrid Laurier University,United States; Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039324793,9,"[Selten, R.]|[ur.015624004054.60]|International Journal of Game Theory|1975|4|1|25-55|10.1007/bf01766400|pub.1031357148|1751;[Wagner, R.

pub.1030282607,10.1080/07488008808408813,Civil protection against chemical and biological warfare,"In the United Kingdom, the value of civil defence remains controversial. Proponents of civil defence argue that it is a necessary humanitarian duty to mitigate the impact of potential future war on the civilian population. Opponents point to ministerial and military statements that the principal function of civil defence is to enhance the credibility of nuclear deterrence, not to protect people.Against a backdrop of this broad debate, the issue of civil preparedness for possible chemical or biological attack is examined. This article considers current expert advice delivered to local authority emergency planning officers and volunteer civil defence Scientific Advisers at a Seminar held in May 1987, in the context of developments in chemical and biological weaponry and UK government policy. Detailed consideration is given to the difficulties in executing suggested individual and collective protection measures, and it is argued that a ‘credibility gap’ exists between advice on protection and the capacity for its effective implementation.",Medicine and War,1988,4,3,135-147,"C, Stewart Kemp",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030282607,0,"[FRS, John H.

The Air Force fostered this linkage in the post World War II and Korea era with its reliance on nuclear weapons and strategy of mutually assured destruction. Bombers continue to be a vital component of our nation's strategic nuclear deterrent forces. However, bombers are not limited to deterring nuclear war. In addition to employing the first nuclear weapons, U.S. war fighting experience shows that bombers have played a crucial role in every major conflict beginning with World War II. Since our experience shows that we have historically employed bombers in a conventional role, the author suggests that we should be prepared to employ them across the spectrum of conflict today. Our experience also clearly shows that bombers have best employed as an element of integrated air power, rarely as an independent force. Therefore, we should prepare to employ bombers as a member of an integrated air power team. The author also suggests that the concepts of tactical and strategic are ill defined and serve to divide air power into organizations and forces. The author draws lessons from World War II and Vietnam experiences which could help guide our preparation for future conflicts.",,1988,,,,"Lumpkin, Phillip R.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091605116,0,

The decisions of 1934-35 to increase British armaments were based on these assumptions: that appeasement and military deterrence were compatible in a dual policy of conciliating and confining Germany and Japan; that the attainment of adequate levels of peacetime strength constituted the best deterrent, although the simultaneous demonstration of force and the will to rearm might restrain the dictators. While British defense policy had not anticipated the possibility of conflict with Italy, the British used a show of force in the Mediterranean in 1935 both to protect their interests and to support the League of Nations against Italy's invasion of Ethiopia. The failure either to prevent or to limit Italian aggression in this crisis convinced most British policymakers that threatening force before completing rearmament would not deter a Fascist regime from territorial expansion, and that deterrence should be defined more narrowly.",Armed Forces & Society,1988,14,3,329-357,"Post, Gaines",Claremont McKenna College,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063730092,3,

pub.1053869494,10.1177/002234338802500105,The Risk of Compulsory Escalation,"This article draws attention to the danger that deliberate escalation will transform into compulsory escalation. According to Clausewitz' philosophy, the use of violence is an instrument of policy. Nuclear deterrence would have brought an end to that philosophy, since the costs of nuclear war always exceed the benefits. However, Clausewitz also suggests the possibility that a war may escalate beyond the break-even point (where cost is equal to benefit) if a nation expects to lose unilaterally. In the nuclear era, the limited use of nuclear weapons may very easily escalate into absolute war because the target feels that its survival is at stake. This argument closely resembles Riezler's theory of bluff developed on the eve of World War I and the possibility that escalation may become uncontrollable in a Krieg aus Not (war from necessity). Just as in 1914, a third world war might break out not on the basis of a calculation that the benefits of warfare are greater than the costs, but as a consequence of compulsory escalation of a crisis or a limited war in which one side perceives that its existence is threatened. Since planning for limited nuclear war and deliberate escalation enhances the probability of compulsory escalation, a nuclear posture of minimum deterrence should be preferred.",Journal of Peace Research,1988,25,1,43-56,"Houweling, Henk W.; Siccama, Jan G.",Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053869494,1,"[Richelson, Jeffrey]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1983|6|2|125-146|10.1080/01402398308437147|pub.1008432241|9;[Brodie, Bernard]|[]||1959||||10.1515/9781400875108|pub.1028600531|198;[Friedberg, Aaron L.]|[]|Journal of Strategic Studies|1980|3|3|37-71|10.1080/01402398008437055|pub.1039830104|19;[Leitenberg, Milton]|[ur.014372051445.83]|Journal of Peace Research|1981|18|4|309-317|10.1177/002234338101800401|pub.1054022909|2;[Carter, Ashton B.]|[]|Scientific American|1985|252|1|32-39|10.1038/scientificamerican0185-32|pub.1056482705|13;[Rosenberg, David Alan]|[]|International Security|1983|7|4|3|10.2307/2626731|pub.1070041581|126;[McNamara, Robert S.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1983|62|1|59|10.2307/20041735|pub.1102754427|50;[Bundy, McGeorge; Kennan, George F.; McNamara, Robert S.; Smith, Gerard]|[ur.014550420323.30; ur.015336541016.34; ur.016134121416.71; ur.07431050216.81]|Foreign Affairs|1982|60|4|753|10.2307/20041171|pub.1102763982|90"

pub.1021037581,10.1017/s0360966900038421,The Morality of Nuclear Deterrence: Obstacles on the Road to Coherence,"Abstract  This essay critically assays four recent attempts to furnish a moral justification for nuclear deterrence: the success thesis, the just war thesis, the argument from the “supreme emergency,” and the exceptionalist thesis. By entering into critical dialogue with representatives of these arguments I hope to show that the current confidence in the morality of nuclear deterrence is ill-conceived. Chief among the logical and practical difficulties plaguing these arguments are the following. (1) The success thesis rests on the fallacy of post hoc, ergo propter hoc reasoning. Nor does the assertion of the past success of deterrence furnish guarantees of future effectiveness. (2) Representatives of the just war thesis either establish conditions for accepting deterrence that are incoherent with their judgments about use (e.g., U.S. Catholic bishops) or develop a theory of deterrence that cannot be morally institutionalized (e.g., David Hollenbach). (3) The argument for the supreme emergency eclipses moral convention in the nuclear age. (4) The attempt to salvage the supreme emergency according to a classical theory of community rests on a fundamental disanalogy between the Aristotelian polis and modern nation-states. Moreover, it opens the door for a double standard to evaluate the methods of war.",Horizons,1988,15,1,21-42,"Miller, Richard B.",Indiana University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021037581,0,"[Schlesinger, James R.]|[]|The Star Wars Controversy|1986|||15-24|10.1515/9781400858163.15|pub.1011386473|4;[Wasserstrom, Richard]|[]|Ethics|1985|95|3|424-444|10.1086/292652|pub.1058602679|2;[Bok, Sissela]|[ur.055523025.42]|Ethics|1985|95|3|712-727|10.1086/292668|pub.1058602695|4;[Posen, Barry R.; Evera, Stephen Van]|[ur.012671322521.68; ur.013530612333.14]|International Security|1983|8|1|3|10.2307/2538484|pub.1069980194|13;[Ball, Desmond]|[]|International Security|1982|7|3|31|10.2307/2538550|pub.1069980251|30;[Bundy, McGeorge; Kennan, George F.; McNamara, Robert S.; Smith, Gerard]|[ur.014550420323.30; ur.015336541016.34; ur.016134121416.71; ur.07431050216.81]|Foreign Affairs|1982|60|4|753|10.2307/20041171|pub.1102763982|90"

La dissuasion nucléaire et la menace soviétique dans le cadre d’analyse de la guerre juste des évêques catholiques américains,"Since the U.S. Catholic bishops gave their ""strictly conditioned"" moral acceptance of nuclear deterrence in 1983, much has changed on the strategic landscape, most notably with the emergence of numerous space-based and defensive schemes, and it is not clear how a committee struck by the hierarchy to review recent developments will respond. There are reasons to suggest the outcome will not be a complete condemnation of deterrence, whatever judgment is mode of current U.S. policies. It is equally likely that the review will fail, as did the 1983 letter, to provide sufficient justification for what it conditionally accepts. The 1983 letter cannot be construed as ""soft"" on the Soviet Union. But Us scant account of an expansionist adversary appears only after its moral judgments and prudential alternatives are stated. The letter, argued in a just war framework, cannot find the language to refer to a particular adversary by name or indicate why deterrence is justified on an interim basis. This f allure is ascribed to two factors. First, Catholic teaching increasingly has restricted the scope of jus ad bellum and shifted its emphasis to jus in bello criteria of discrimination and proportionality in judging modem war. Second, within a generation, the U.S. hierarchy has redefined its relationship to its society and become less willing to alter Church teaching to accomodate national purposes, even while affirming in general terms the traditional right and duty of self-defence. Y et insofar as this right remains operative, the bishops' inability to describe what is to be defended, and from what, leaves the reader unclear as to why the U.S. and its allies should possess nuclear weapons even, or only, conditionally.",Études Internationales,1988,19,1,33-55,"Epp, Roger",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041409726,1,

pub.1042630798,10.1080/00455091.1987.10715917,Nuclear Hardware and Power: The War of Perceptions,"Nations possessing nuclear weapons have seen them as useful for many purposes. These include classic nuclear deterrence (preventing a nuclear attack), extended nuclear deterrence (preventing a conventional attack on the nuclear nation or allied countries), the fighting of a nuclear war ‘if deterrence fails,’ and a ‘diplomatic’ use in which the weapons are seen as implements of coercive political power. Concerning all these uses profound ethical questions arise. It is the last use which will be the focus of attention in this paper. I have chosen this subject partly because I believe that it has received insufficient attention from those reflecting on nuclear policies from an ethical point of view. Discussions tend to focus on the use, threat to use, or intention to use nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack or threat of nuclear attack. The retention of nuclear weapons for such a purpose is far easier to rationalize than is the development of such weapons for extended deterrence, nuclear ‘diplomacy,’ or the actual waging of a nuclear war. Historically, nuclear weapons have been held by nuclear states for all these purposes. In fact, there are natural relations between the functions. When a power possesses nuclear weapons, the ultimate token of military power in the modern world, it is natural that it will seek to use them for purposes less restricted than the sole one of deterring nuclear war. Hence there is a natural development from classic deterrence to extended deterrence and the coercive use of nuclear weapons in the pursuit of national interest. There is also a natural connection between classic deterrence and the development and deployment of nuclear weapons for the purpose of fighting and ‘prevailing’ in a nuclear war. An opposing state is to be prevented from attacking by the belief that an attack would be followed by retaliation. That requires that a nuclear state indicate the will and capacity to retaliate-that is, to use these weapons in a real war if necessary.",Canadian Journal of Philosophy,1987,17,4,749-766,"GOVIER, TRUDY",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042630798,0,"[Jervis, Robert]|[]|International Security|1982|7|3|3|10.2307/2538549|pub.1069980249|70;[Sagan, Carl]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1983|62|2|257|10.2307/20041818|pub.1102764194|111"

Nuclear defence policy, as I conceive it, is concerned with addressing the threat Soviet nuclear weapons pose for Western security. I argue that, contrary to popular opinion, MAD is not a retributive doctrine—that in fact it violates two constitutive principles of retribution: culpability and proportionality. After explicating these constitutive principles, I apply them to retaliatory strategy—showing that the culpability criterion restricts retaliation to the agents of aggression while the proportionality criterion requires a just measure of retaliation. The result is a defence policy continuous with the just war tradition—one which rules out deterrence based on threats against the civilian population. I show why a retributive policy requires non-nuclear forces and discuss the feasiblity of replacing all nuclear forces with conventional weapons. I anticipate and answer major objections to the denuclearization of U.S. and NATO forces. Finally, I conclude that an advocate of a retributive policy—specifically, a policy calling for a proportional or measured response against combatants only—must be willing, in the name of justice, to accept the risk of making war more thinkable by making it less horrible.",Journal of Applied Philosophy,1987,4,2,135-153,"MYERS, DAVID B.",Minnesota State University Moorhead,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050404528,0,"[BENN, S.

The hierarchical structure of the model permits the use of different approaches and greater flexibility than existing models allow. At some stages of the model, the optimum criterion is the minimization of the probability of war, or (in a wider range) the “war potential”; at other stages, the criteria are more specific (for example, the minimization of time that is needed to realize the planned disarmament. Several qualitative results are derived from the model, including the formal description of a process of possible replacement of nuclear deterrence as a tool of international stability by the independent peace movement.",Journal of Conflict Resolution,1987,31,3,525-542,"Reitman, Mark",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035945653,0,"[Intriligator, Michael D.; Brito, Dagobert L.]|[ur.013222136254.32; ur.011606711745.78]|Public Choice|1981|37|2|247-260|10.1007/bf00138245|pub.1001826668|39;[Wallace, Michael D.; Crissey, Brian L.; Sennott, Linn I.]|[; ur.012530126515.01; ur.010761357607.46]|Journal of Peace Research|1986|23|1|9-27|10.1177/002234338602300102|pub.1048675085|14;[Reitman, Mark]|[]|Journal of Peace Research|1983|20|2|171-177|10.1177/002234338302000205|pub.1053842997|2;[Intriligator, Michael D.]|[]|Journal of Political Economy|1975|83|2|339-354|10.1086/260326|pub.1058573807|100;[Intriligator, Michael D.; Brito, Dagobert L.]|[ur.013222136254.32; ur.011606711745.78]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1984|28|1|63-84|10.1177/0022002784028001004|pub.1063626252|90;[Mayer, Thomas F.]|[]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1986|30|1|3-28|10.1177/0022002786030001001|pub.1063626280|12;[]|[]|European Geographical Studies|2015|8|4||10.13187/egs.2015.8.156|pub.1065012089|33"

Hoffmann finds the world order of 1987 to contain both these systems and judges it both ambiguous and original. While the tension of these extremes can make the world appear “anarchical,” there are certain agreed upon rules by which the superpowers interact. These rules ultimately preserve order by embracing competition between the United States and the Soviet Union; superpower confrontation is prevented by each nation holding to their own ideals and sovereignty while embracing nuclear deterrence. Having revealed the rules of the superpower game, Hoffmann then subjects them to ethical judgment. Despite the historic duration of peace between superpowers that seems to have been sustained by these rules, Hoffmann finds them both ethically flawed and ultimately unstable. Turning to a brief consideration of United States foreign policy, he points to particular moral difficulties in U.S. stances and urges the development of superpower rules that are effective and ethical.",Ethics & International Affairs,1987,1,,37-51,"Hoffmann, Stanley",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036028098,5,"[Bull, Hedley]|[]||1977||||10.1007/978-1-349-24028-9|pub.1028572437|1681;[Keohane, Robert O.]|[ur.014127647347.69]|International Organization|1986|40|1|1-27|10.1017/s0020818300004458|pub.1038186284|375;[Gaddis, John Lewis]|[ur.016532551731.87]|International Security|1986|10|4|99|10.2307/2538951|pub.1069980584|146"

pub.1008422696,10.1515/auk-1987-1-208,Nuclear Deterrence and Just War Theory,"The just war tradition stands as the moral and prudential alternative to both pacifism and realism. It forms the only reasonable ethical basis for the understanding of state initiated force. As applied to questions of nuclear deterrence, just war theory is incompatible with Mutual Assured Destruction and with the threat of MAD. Just war theory entails a move toward counterforce with discriminate targeting of military capabilities and away from city targeting . This is now becoming possible technically and is morally indicated. The counterforce option is realistic in that nuclear disarmament is an extremely remote possibility and alternate strategies such as bluff ore not workable. A counterforce strategy would be both discriminate and proportional as well as being in accord with political realism.",Analyse & Kritik,1987,9,1-2,142-154,"Phillips, Robert L.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008422696,0,

It is argued that, in terms of the criteria of just war tradition, deterrence in its present form poses grave moral problems. The two new weapons systems are then examined in terms of whether, by just war criteria, they represent more moral means of defense than contemporary nuclear deterrence.",Analyse & Kritik,1987,9,1-2,120-141,"Johnson, James Turner",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022665880,0,

It is argued that a consequentialist approach to the moral assessment of nuclear deterrence is in principle able to provide a solution to this dilemma by reducing the moral dilemma to a non-moral dilemma which can in turn be solved by a comparison of risks. In this connection, a theory of the ‘functional’ assessment of intentions is developed in order to subject even threats involving a conditional intention to retaliate to consequentialist reasoning.",Analyse & Kritik,1987,9,1-2,175-192,"Birnbacher, Dieter",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042918217,1,

Some changes in the real strategic problem of the west must be considered, including the growth of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Changes in our perception of the problem may be at least as important, however, amid some possibilities of ‘Finlandisation’. Changes in the West’s opportunities must also be considered, including ‘limited nuclear war’, and a totally conventional defense. Finally to be considered are the bureaucratic motivations of those advocating any such changes in western military postures, all of which suggest that current policies may still be better than the alternatives.",Analyse & Kritik,1987,9,1-2,82-96,"Quester, George H.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067521752,0,

The central problem with a policy of deterrence is that the threat of retaliation may not be credible if retaliation leads to a worse outcome - perhaps a nuclear holocaust - than a side would suffer from absorbing a limited first strike and not retaliating. - The optimality of deterrence is analyzed by means of a Deterrence Game based on Chicken, in which each player chooses a probability (or level) of preemption, and of retaliation if preempted. The Nash equilibria, or stable outcomes, in this game are compared with those in a Star Wars Game, in which the preemption and retaliation levels are constrained by the defensive capabilities of each side. Unlike threats in the Deterrence Game, which can always stabilize the cooperative outcome, mutual preemption emerges as an equilibrium in the Star Wars Game, underscoring the problem - particularly if defensive capabilities are unbalanced - that deterrence will be subverted by the development of Star Wars.",Analyse & Kritik,1987,9,1-2,62-74,"Brams, Steven J.; Kilgour, D.

The Blake and Pole volumes, containing essays mainly by British philosophers, are distinguished by unrelenting and comprehensive opposition to British and American policy, and by the fame of the contributors, which include Anthony Kenny, Michael Dummett, and Bernard Williams. The Chicago volume contains a number of excellent papers by philosophers and the added bonus of nine papers by established specialists in national security issues; it attempts, with partial success, to cover the full range of strategic nuclear options. The Cohen and Lee and the Fox and Groarke volumes consist largely of papers by strategic outsiders far from the centres of political power; the debate in these volumes is not between the principal versions of nuclear deterrence but between nuclear deterrence in any form and some scheme that transcends the present arrangement of mutually deterring superpowers. Of these last two books, Cohen and Lee contains relatively longer and more detailed essays.",Dialogue,1987,26,2,341-348,"Lackey, Douglas P.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054781470,0,"[Gauthier, David]|[]|Ethics|1984|94|3|474-495|10.1086/292561|pub.1058602588|31"

Some of those misgivings centre on issues of effectiveness: safety depends entirely upon the dissuasion of an adversary. Other misgivings centre on moral concerns: the essence of deterrence is the threat, and the conditional intention, to kill millions of noncombatants. US President Reagan's Strategic Defence Initiative promised an alternative to deterrence, a strategic posture of interception of an adversary's weapons rather than preclusion of the decision to attack. It is conceived as a means of ‘defending’ the United States that does not threaten anyone. In this essay I examine various SDI proposals. I argue that only one of these could justify the transition to a strategic posture of ‘defence’, and might be a genuine alternative to deterrence—the one that is least feasible technologically. Only that one could plausibly be claimed to be morally superior to deterrence—and for strategic reasons, even its claim is dubious at best. Technologically more feasible proposals are not ‘defences’, but variants of deterrence. Since that is so, the most common and dramatic claim of their moral superiority to deterrence is incoherent.",Journal of Applied Philosophy,1986,3,2,151-166,"SCHONSHECK, JONATHAN",Le Moyne College,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023036990,0,

The United States expanded their civil defense program in the 1950's to include a measure of protection in the event of the explosion of nuclear devices. However, the history of the United States civil defense program has been generally characterized by inadequate funding and little interest at all levels of government. Most recently, our civil defense program has been associated and considered a component of our nuclear deterrence. Under the direction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, our government will rely on crisis relocation as the primary means of protecting the population in the event of a nuclear attack or detonation. This plan envisions that evacuation of the population from high risk areas to safer host areas. Does crisis relocation provide our country with a credible component to our nuclear deterrence? Do our leaders and citizens have confidence in our nation's ability to protect our civilian population? Have our leaders been completely forthright in preparing the population for the possibility of a nuclear war?

Popular debate oscillates tediously between an apparently impractical idealism which would have nothing to do with the things, and a military and political realism which insists that we have to use such means to attain our legitimate ends. The choice, it too often seems, is between laying down our nuclear arms–thus avoiding the moral odium of resting our defence policies on threats to vaporize millions of civilians–but leaving ourselves open to domination by those who do not feel such scruples, and on the other hand, retaining such weapons as long as our potential enemies possess them, constantly maintaining parity with the other side–in other words, proceeding with the arms race. The respective proponents of principle and of prudence typically fail to understand how others can possibly neglect the considerations which loom so large in their own minds. Each has at bottom a deeply held ethical view–that certain means (deployment of nuclear weapons) may not be used for any end, or that certain ends (defending our freedom and national sovereignty) are so important that they justify the use of almost any means. The disagreement is so irreconcilable that it spills out from TV studios and newspaper editorial pages on to the streets and the missile bases, and into the courts and the prisons.",Philosophy,1986,61,236,193-214,"Stevenson, Leslie",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053994258,0,"[Hare, J.

In 1982 it decided to fit that submarine with the D‐5 missile. In the 1983 general election the Conservative government won handily, in part, on the issue of the continued legitimacy of nuclear deterrence. As a result, the government's decision to modernize the independent deterrent appeared to be supported by electoral mandate (although the question of specific support for Trident remained open).In fact, support within the government and among members of the British strategic community has become less than enthusiastic due primarily to the rising costs of the Trident program. Also, the opposition parties and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament have declared their opposition to Trident.The future of the British strategic deterrent is thus being shaped in a very ambivalent environment. On the one hand, the basic programmatic decisions have been made and apparently ratified by the electoral process. On the other hand, significant doubts remain about the Trident decision. This article examines these doubts and projects the likely range of choices in the years ahead as well as the implications of various alternatives for Britain's allies and the Soviet Union.",Comparative Strategy,1986,5,4,323-349,"Laird, Robbin F.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007874693,0,"[Baylis, John]|[]||1984||||10.1007/978-1-349-17579-6|pub.1022602806|65;[]|[]||1983||||10.1007/978-1-349-17293-1|pub.1024750917|3;[Freedman, Lawrence]|[]||1980||||10.1007/978-1-349-16388-5|pub.1031447882|77;[Baylis, John]|[ur.012437655771.10]|Nuclear War and Nuclear Peace|1983|||116-152|10.1007/978-1-349-17003-6_4|pub.1033873793|1;[Bidwell, Shelford]|[ur.013331626623.35]|International Affairs|1983|59|4|725-726|10.2307/2619485|pub.1070035748|4"

Consider a representative passage: ‘With the generation that has never known a world unmenaced by nuclear weapons, a new order of the generation begins. In it, each person alive is called on to assume his share of the responsibility for guaranteeing the existence of all future generations.’ I have no doubt that many people in most countries — citizens of representative democracies in particular — know this call and feel in some dim and tentative way that there must be special individual responsibilities that have evolved with that defensive, strategic and political doctrine we know as nuclear deterrence.

The distinction seems to be an example of the invalid dichotomy between analytic and synthetic truths; it is also inapplicable to the bishops' condemnation of nuclear war as a concrete action immoral in principle.

A review of the literature generated by The Challenge of Peace provides a survey of the current state of opinion on this question. The bishops, who seek to apply traditional just war categories to the novel situation of the nuclear era, are opposed by representatives of other traditional positions (the arms control community, which tolerates the targeting of civilians, and the “limited war” school, which eschews civilian targets). Two new approaches, likewise opposed to that of the pastoral, set more radical limits to nuclear targeting.

Some argue that, due to the lack of operational reserves, the Western Alliance would be confronted with the nuclear decision too early to lend sufficient credibility to strategic nuclear deterrence. Others claim that American strategic deterrence has indeed become ineffective for the Western Alliance ever since the United States have lost their nuclear monopoly. An extreme view suggests that the employment of American ‘tactical nuclear weapons’ (TNW) in the defense of Europe should not be acceptable to the United States unless she makes it absolutely clear to the Soviet Union that under no circumstances will her strategic forces be used in a military conflict in Europe.

It is not necessary to win a nuclear war in order to deter it; one has only to ensure that both are likely to lose it.   It takes (at least) two to make a war, and of those combatants, one (at least) must start it. If nobody starts the war, there won't be a war. This is as true in the nuclear era as it ever was.

It is the fear of these effects that France has used to justify her refusal to become part of Protocol I. At the time of the signing of Protocol I, the US and Great Britain made the declaration that the new regulations as introduced by Protocol I ""are not intended to have any effect on and do not regulate or prohibit the use of nuclear weapons"" . It appears that, for a reason which has nothing to do with atomic weapons, the Reagan administration intends not to ask the Senate for ratification of Protocol I. The governments of Italy and Belgium who ratified the Protocol in February and May 1986 respectively, have supplemented their ratification with a declaration similar to that of the two powers. As for the legality of the use of nuclear weapons, the answer must from now on rely on the combination of Protocol I and the ""nuclear clause"" from the declaration of the two powers and their allies. Hence the status of nuclear weapons in international law is comprised of three elements : a) The first use of nuclear weapons is not, in itself prohibited. - b) This use is subjected to the regulations of the common law of war, as has been ""reaffirmed"" by Protocol I, and which applies both to conventional and nuclear weapons. - c) The bans and restrictions, as provided for in these regulations, and which mark out the thin bounds which allow for the use of atomic weapons, pertain only to the use of these arms and not to nuclear deterrence.",Études Internationales,1986,17,3,549-569,"Meyrowitz, Henri",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022902428,0,

I suggest a deterrent ``force,'' or perhaps more appropriately a ``restraining presence,'' that uniquely combines inhibition of war-like or destabilizing acts in the short term with the simultaneous enhancement of transnational understanding over the longer term, at all levels of the body politic. Specifically, I propose a highly visible, mutially endorsed and deliberately massive effort by both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. in support of a confidence-building program involving the reciprocal exchange, from one nation to the other, of large numbers of citizen ``hostages'' chosen from all walks of life.

pub.1115160825,10.11375/kokusaiseiji1957.80_16,Disarmament and Security,"With the advent of the nuclear age, the theory and practice of deterrence changed drastically compared to the classical doctrine of deterrence. The pioneer of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, Bernard Brodie, in his first book on nuclear war, explained that “the first and most vital step in any American security program for the age of the atomic bomb is to take measures to guarantee to ourselves in case of attack the possibility of retaliation in kind. Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win war. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert war.” Since then the truth of this doctrine has been accepted in the Western world as self-evident, and the national security policy of the United States and its allies continues to be based on the concept of nuclear deterrence. But the practices of this doctrine over more than 35 years have brought the world the kind of dangerous situation in which national security, in both East and West, is now being threatened seriously by the probability of nuclear war or at least the possible use of nuclear weapons. This is the inevitable outcome of the contradiction which lies in the very nature of the strategy of nuclear deterrence being complicated by the number and variety of nuclear forces and the development of missile technology: the growing accuracy of guidance systems, the minituarization of warheads and the MIRV-ed systems. The strategy of nuclear deterrence has continually changed, from war-deterrence to war-fighting, as Brodie deplored in his last article: abandon deterrence strategy in favor of war-winning strategy. Problems of national security, international stability, disarmement and arms control policy became so much more complex than ever before that it became indispensable to reassess these problems from the viewpoint of a new approach differing from the traditional thought of power politics and national security policy. At the time of the Second Special Session on Disarmament of the United Nations held in 1982 (SSD-II), two reports were pesented to that session. The first, the “Study on Relationship between Disarmament and International Security, ” was presented by a group of experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The report puts special emphasis on the intimate relationship between disarmament and iternational security and asserts that parallelism and co-ordination of measures in both the disarmament and the security fields are the only logical and practical solution to the problem. Although this suggestion is important, the report overlooks the detrimental effects of national security policy or military strategy on the disarmament problem. The second is the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues, the Palme Commission, entitled “Common Security.” According to the report, nations must begin to organize their security policies in cooperation with one another under conditions in which nations have an overwhelming common interest in avoiding nuclear war. The commission explicitly contrasted common security and deterrence. But common security and deterrence are in some respects complementary, particularly in concrete policy-maning. To avoid this dilemma, the philosophy of common security must have a prospect of a world in which the present military block division does not apply.",International Relations,1985,1985,80,"16-30,l7","SUGIE, Eiichi",Chukyo University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115160825,0,

This paper tries, primarily through the Diet debates, to review how the Japanese disarmament policy with such non-nuclear principles as its basis has evolved in the face of reality. The three non-nuclear principles were set up by the then Prime Minister Sato, first in December 1967 and again in January 1968 in the form of the answer to the question in the Diet debates. However, these principles were originally considered to constitute “the four nuclear policies.” In fact, the government and the ruling party decided to keep the three non-nuclear principles only if the Japanese national security is insured by the U. S. nuclear deterrence. This is how the Japanese disarmament policy started to evolve under the strange combination of the opposing policies, which adheres to the three non-nuclear principles on the one hand and continues to rely on the U. S. nuclear deterrence on the other. At first the dilemma showed itself when ratification of Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was put on the agenda of the Diet debates. The government made it clear to the ruling party to continue its reliance on the U. S. nuclear deterrence, but it also stressed to the opposition parties its adherence to the non-nuclear principles as well. And the second occation appeared at the first and second U. N. Special Sessions on Disarmament. While the Japanese government proclaimed to the international community that it would continue to keep the three non-nuclear principles, it declined, from the standpoint of nuclear balances, to support the U. N. resolutions on no use and no deployment of nuclear weapons. The gap between its pursuit of the ideal of non-nuclear policy and its real course of action has increasingly widened particulary after the Afgan incident. The way Japan acted itself in the Williamsburg summit of May 1983, in connection with the INF negociations between the U. S. and the U. S. S. R. made it clear that Japan stood on the side of the West in the field of the nuclear disarmament. Since then, the effectiveness of the nuclear deferrence and nuclear balances has been stressed much strongly, and it seems that the Japanese non-nuclear policy based on the three non-nuclear principles has declined in its importance. It is also true that recently, out of deep concern for such trend, there has been voices to call out the danger of being rested on the nuclear balances and stress the importance of bringing down the nuclear balances to much lower level. What Japan needs to do now is to clarify once again its position as the only country which suffered atomic explosion, and establish an independent nuclear disarmament policy which clearly sees to the starting point of the non-nuclear policy, and promote the nuclear disarmament diplomacy which is firmly based on that policy.",International Relations,1985,1985,80,"63-79,l10","SAKURAGAWA, Akiyoshi",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115163976,0,

It does so by analyzing its substantive contents, demonstrating its internal contradictions and discrepancies, and by examining its impact on several aspects of the arms race. The technological condition of mutual assured destruction is seen as an accurate description of the capabilities of the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. This reality, however, has given rise to an ideology of nuclear deterrence, which is used as a framework for understanding the global order and in turn fuels the arms race. Nuclear deterrence is a militarily and psychologically complex process that is poorly understood by the public, and left vaguely defined by the military-industrial-governmental defense elite. Evidence of the ideological nature of deterrence is contained in its many internal contradictions, and the discrepancies between officials’ use of deterrence visá-vis the public and amongst themselves. Further demonstration of its ideological nature resides in the very nature of deterrence itself: it incorporates nonverifiable assertions as cognitive beliefs, and does not permit the questioning of its tenets. The paper concludes with a brief review of some of the consequences of reliance on deterrence in the areas of: our inability to control the arms race, the lack of defensive capabilities, the primacy of the iron triangle, and the seeds of self-destruction inherent in deterrence ideology.",Sociological Quarterly,1985,26,3,311-330,"Marullo, Sam",Cleveland State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007594672,3,"[Kramer, Bernard M.; Kalick, S.

pub.1063626274,10.1177/0022002785029003002,Understanding Global War,"While the problem of war in general deserves continuing scholarly attention, it seems appropriate to single out the systemwide—that is, global—war for intensive analysis as the kind of war that poses the gravest threat of catastrophe. Such a war can best be understood as an integral part of a long cycle, a recurring pattern in the development and operation of the global layer of the international system. From this perspective the design of a solution to the problem of global war requires either disruption of the long cycle or the development of a functional substitute for the leadership selection process that these wars have provided for the global system. The dominant contemporary solution to the problem, nuclear deterrence, ignores this perspective, and thereby overestimates the long-term utility and viability of deterrence. Deterrence theory also fails to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why and how deterrence works. Thus we must search for a creative alternative; and while its exact nature cannot be described, some relevant lines of inquiry can be identified.",Journal of Conflict Resolution,1985,29,3,391-417,"Modelski, George; Morgan, Patrick M.",University of Washington; Washington State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063626274,16,"[Kugler, Jacek]|[ur.0766755653.36]|Journal of Conflict Resolution|1984|28|3|470-506|10.1177/0022002784028003005|pub.1000256557|38;[Bull, Hedley]|[]|The Future of Strategic Deterrence|1981|||13-23|10.1007/978-1-349-06186-0_3|pub.1018189691|5;[Rasler, Karen A.; Thompson, William R.]|[ur.015761342615.53; ur.010053652015.13]|World Politics|1983|35|4|489-516|10.2307/2010387|pub.1019456732|46;[Modelski, George]|[]|Comparative Studies in Society and History|1978|20|2|214-235|10.1017/s0010417500008914|pub.1020255686|166;[Rasler, Karen A.; Thompson, William R.]|[ur.015761342615.53; ur.010053652015.13]|American Political Science Review|1985|79|2|491-507|10.2307/1956662|pub.1041229410|81;[Thompson, William R.; Zuk, L.

Section 1 explores the assumptions that are necessary to generate this moral paradox. Some moral theorists, however, have refused to embrace this paradox, contending instead that nuclear deterrence is immoral in principle precisely because it is wrong to threaten that which it would be immoral to do. Section 2 rebuts this contention and seeks to reduce the apparent paradoxicality of nuclear deterrence to manageable proportions. This is not to maintain, though, that nuclear deterrence is morally permissible in the world in which we live; consequently, Section 3 surveys some of the factors relevant to a moral assessment of the legitimacy of the actual practice of nuclear deterrence.",Journal of Applied Philosophy,1985,2,1,41-52,"SHAW, WILLIAM H.",Tennessee State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042133539,1,

pub.1040254276,10.2307/2010141,Conventional Deterrence: Predictive Uncertainty and Policy Confidence,"For over three decades the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has based its deterrent on the principle that the United States would retaliate with nuclear weapons if a Soviet conventional attack against Western Europe succeeded. This notion has long troubled most strategic analysts. It remained generally acceptable to political elites, however, when U.S. nuclear superiority appeared massive enough to make the doctrine credible (as in the 1950s); when the conventional military balance in Europe improved markedly (as in the 1960s); or when détente appeared to be making the credibility of deterrence a less pressing concern (as in the 1970s). None of these conditions exists in the 1980s, and anxiety over the danger of nuclear war has prompted renewed attention to the possibility of replacing NATO's Flexible Response doctrine (a mixture of nuclear and conventional deterrence) with a reliable conventional deterrence posture that might justify a nuclear no-first-use (NFU) doctrine. 1",World Politics,1985,37,2,153-179,"Betts, Richard K.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040254276,22,"[Sutton, Boyd D.; Landry, John R.; Armstrong, Malcolm B.; Estes, Howell M.; Clark, Wesley K.]|[; ; ; ; ]|Survival|1984|26|2|50-70|10.1080/00396338408442156|pub.1002607309|12;[Gouré, Daniel; Cooper, Jeffrey R.]|[; ]|Comparative Strategy|1984|4|3|215-248|10.1080/01495938408402667|pub.1051040356|3;[Fromm, Joseph]|[]|Defence and Consensus|1983|||29-35|10.1007/978-1-349-07141-8_4|pub.1052579754|1;[Schoenbaum, David; van Creveld, Martin]|[; ]|International Security|1983|8|1|201|10.2307/2538492|pub.1069980203|1;[Evangelista, Matthew A.]|[]|International Security|1982|7|3|110|10.2307/2538554|pub.1069980255|27;[Posen, Barry R.]|[ur.012671322521.68]|International Security|1984|9|3|47|10.2307/2538587|pub.1069980283|27;[Lautenschlager, Karl]|[]|International Security|1983|8|2|3|10.2307/2538594|pub.1069980288|12;[Huntington, Samuel P.]|[]|International Security|1983|8|3|32|10.2307/2538699|pub.1069980381|46;[Hampson, Fen Osler]|[]|International Security|1983|8|3|57|10.2307/2538700|pub.1069980383|3;[Betts, Richard K.]|[]|International Security|1983|7|4|140|10.2307/2626735|pub.1070041585|22;[McNamara, Robert S.]|[]|Foreign Affairs|1983|62|1|59|10.2307/20041735|pub.1102754427|50;[Bundy, McGeorge; Kennan, George F.; McNamara, Robert S.; Smith, Gerard]|[ur.014550420323.30; ur.015336541016.34; ur.016134121416.71; ur.07431050216.81]|Foreign Affairs|1982|60|4|753|10.2307/20041171|pub.1102763982|90"

pub.1054886580,10.1017/s0265052500000200,Morality and Paradoxical Deterrence*,"Nuclear deterrence is paradoxical. One paradox of nuclear deterrence we may call the rationality paradox: (RP) (1) While it is a rational policy to threaten nuclear retaliation against an opponent armed with nuclear weapons, it would not be rational to carry out the retaliation should the threat fail to deter; and (2) what would not be rational to do is not, in the circumstances characteristic of nuclear deterrence, rational to threaten to do.  This is a paradox in the standard sense that it involves contradictory claims, for it implies that adopting a policy of nuclear deterrence is both rational and not rational, yet we have strong reason to believe that each of the claims is true. Claim (1) is a recognition that, though we believe nuclear deterrence works, there would seem to be no reason to carry out the threat if it were to fail. Claim (2) is part of the logic of all forms of deterrence, military and nonmilitary, and it relates to the important notion of credibility: if an opponent knows that one has no reason to carry out a threat, the threat would not be credible and so one would have no reason to make it. Further, it is characteristic of a state of nuclear deterrence that the opponent would recognize that one would have no reason to carry out the threat.  The rationality paradox is but one of the paradoxes raised by nuclear deterrence. Some other of the paradoxes of nuclear deterrence have the same form as the rationality paradox: for a certain set of predicates x, (PND) (1) the act of threatening nuclear retaliation (against an opponent with nuclear weapons) is x, while the act of carrying out the threat would be not-x; and (2) if it is not-x to perform some action, then, in the circumstances generally characteristic of a situation of nuclear deterrence, it is not-x to threaten to perform that action.",Social Philosophy and Policy,1985,3,1,136-153,"Lee, Steven",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054886580,0,"[Iklé, Fred Charles]|[ur.012425557023.38]|Foreign Affairs|1973|51|2|267|10.2307/20037978|pub.1102764107|37"

The answer must be sought, in the first instance, by setting aside the particular historic theories of geopolitics—of Mahan, Mackinder, Kjellen, Spykman or Gottman, as such—but in utilizing, nevertheless, the fundamental elements of their geopolitics as generic properties of international politics. The specific ways in which nuclear weapons have impacted actually upon their theories, and the geopolitical consequences they have for contemporary international politics can only take meaning from this prior disengagement of generic elements from their historical context.

Beyond Utilitarianism In the summer of 1982, I published an article called “Missiles and Morals,” in which I argued on utilitarian grounds that nuclear deterrence in its present form is not morally justifiable. The argument of “Missiles and Morals” compared the most likely sort of nuclear war to develop under nuclear deterrence (DET) with the most likely sort of nuclear war to develop under American unilateral nuclear disaramament (UND). For a variety of reasons, I claimed diat the number of casualties in a two-sided nuclear war developing under DET would be at least fifteen times greater than the number of casualties in a one-sided nuclear attack developing under UND. If one assumes that human lives lost or saved is the principal criterion by which nuclear weapons policies should be measured, it follows that DET is morally superior to UND on utilitarian grounds only if the chance of a two-sided nuclear war under DET is more than fifteen times less dian the chance of a one-sided nuclear attack under UND. Since I did not believe that the chance of nuclear war under deterrence is fifteen times less than the chance of nuclear war under unilateral nuclear disarmament, I inferred diat utilitaranism failed to justify DET.

Correspondingly, the moral obligation to discourage such a crime or, if it occurs, to deny it victory, has been underscored. The consequences of a successful defense are fearful to contemplate, but the consequences of a successful aggression, with tyrannical monopoly of the weapons of mass destruction, are calculated to be worse. While the avoidance of excessive and indiscriminate violence, and of such destruction as would undermine the basis for future peace, remain moral imperatives in a just war, it does not seem possible to draw a line in advance, beyond which it would be better to yield than to resist. Reinhold Neibuhr. … the person who deeply desires peace rejects any kind of pacifism which is cowardice or the simple preservation of tranquility. In fact, those who are tempted to impose their domination will always encounter the resistance of intelligent and courageous men and women, prepared to defend freedom in order to promote justice. Pope John Paul II For two generations the United States has maintained with its principal adversary, the Soviet Union, a security relationship based upon the deterrence of war by the possession of means deemed adequate to inflict unacceptable levels of damage in response to a Soviet attack upon the United States or its allies. Against the Soviet Union, the world's largest land power, in possession of superior conventional forces that could be launched against Western Europe and other peripheral regions of the continents of Europe and Asia, the United States has held nuclear capabilities as the ultimate weapon to be invoked in support of those interests deemed to be most vital to American security.",Social Philosophy and Policy,1985,3,1,74-92,"Pfaltzgraff, Robert L.",Tufts University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054886577,0,

Alliance fears that the FRG might withdraw from NATO, adopt a ""social defense,"" dismantle the Federal army, or evict U.S. troops are unfounded. But the West German defense policy consensus has eroded in some respects. The perception that the Soviet Union poses a military threat to the FRG has become weakened. Therefore, the perceived need for deterrence, especially nuclear deterrence, has also lost strength. More and more West Germans are beginning to question whether key American and West German interests are still identical, and some fear that the FRG could be dragged into a war possibly set off by bellicose U.S. policy outside of Europe. The heterogeneous ""peace movement"" will continue to face problems in translating a longing for peace into a realistic and concrete policy for peace; however, the continuing NATO missile deployment will keep it alive for at least a while. The West German government will be compelled to pay far greater heed to domestic opinions on defense questions and to explain to the public more persuasively the necessity and rationale for the country's defense and for its military collaboration with the United States. The FRG will step up its demands for more participation in NATO decisions, and NATO will have to pay closer attention to West Germany's needs and demands. West European public opinion is powerfully influenced by official statements made in Washington. The political style and tone of American leaders are almost as important as actual policy.

The problem is to decide what kinds of reasons there are, and how to arrive in the light of them at determinate conclusions about deterrence and unilateral disarmament. Consequential arguments would be powerful, if only they were determinate; but not only do they not point conclusively to one strategy rather than another, there is not even sufficient reason for accepting one rather than another of the competing optimising criteria by which the strategies might be assessed. So the reasons of other kinds against forming a conditional intention to retaliate with a massive second strike could be conclusive, if retaliation itself could do no (consequential) good, and if, as is claimed, the conditional intention could not be simulated. To form such an intention is held to be contrary to core values of a humane, rationalist culture. To assent to a nuclear retaliatory strike would do violence to the moral nature of anyone participating in such a culture, and to form an intention to make (or condone) such a strike would be a corruption of such a nature. So too would condoning the fostering of such an intention in others, as a way of making the retaliatory intention credible. The author accordingly considers this argument against MAD, and for unilateral nuclear disarmament, sufficient, given the inadequacy of the consequential arguments, while acknowledging that this might involve great sacrifice. The paper concludes, however, by considering whether anyone can reject nuclear deterrence who also believes that resistance to Nazism in 1939 was justified, given the then prevailing belief that the war might be massively destructive. The author holds that there is no inconsistency in both supporting resistance to evil, even at risk of total destruction, and in refusing to form or condone a conditional intention to do equivalent but pointless evil in order to make a threat credible.",Journal of Applied Philosophy,1984,1,1,5-20,"BENN, S.

In doing so, he questioned the traditional orthodoxy of nuclear deterrence, which holds that the vulnerability of both sides preserves the peace. Although the President recognized that such a defense probably could not be achieved before the end of the century, he felt it would be foolish to dismiss the technological possibility altogether, since it is impossible to predict all scientific breakthroughs. The President's speech raises questions about America's strategic nuclear policy, especially with regard to defensive systems. Will such systems prove destabilizing? Could they protect the United States against nuclear attacks? How soon could they be available?

To take the last point first, the complete absence of public discussion about Britain’s decision of the 1940s to go nuclear, was later followed by a similar lack of effective debate about the decision to opt for Polaris. At the moment there is much public disquiet about the Trident decision even amongst those who believe that Britain should retain its own deterrent. On the one hand, this reflects a significant reluctance to take on trust the decisions of small groups of officials who feel unable to reveal the basis of their calculations because of its obvious confidentiality. This distrust is revealed in doubts about the validity of the so-called ‘Moscow criterion’ and in the continued constituency of support for a cruise missile solution of some sort. The clash of the military need for confidentiality and the political need for more frankness of debate increases the lack of strategic consensus in the country. The problem is aggravated in Britain because we are the only country to opt for two distinct methods of nuclear deterrence: the one of relying on the nuclear weapons of another country operating from our soil and the other, Gaullist, solution of relying on our own. The resultant natural confusion of doctrine also plays a part in clouding the debate.",The Future of British Sea Power,1984,,,136-137,"Till, Geoffrey",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049267163,0,
pub.1016639516,10.1017/s1049096500023751,The Dual Problems of Peace and National Security,"The strategic consensus that has characterized American official and popular thinking about nuclear weapons since World War II has greatly eroded in recent years. That consensus consisted not only of an American determination to use nuclear weapons to deter a direct Soviet attack on the United States but also of a commitment to extend the American deterrent to cover a Soviet nuclear or large-scale conventional attack on America's principal allies. In the face of the recent massive and continuing growth of Soviet nuclear and conventional capabilities this consensus has come under growing challenge.                   This challenge to the consensus on the policy of nuclear deterrence has come from both ends of the political spectrum. On the political “right,” the Reagan administration has argued that deterrence alone is too weak a reed to forestall a Soviet attack on the United States or one of its allies; the prevention of a Soviet attack requires the development of a nuclear war-fighting strategy similar to that which the Soviets themselves are presumed to possess. On the political “left,” a large and highly vocal antinuclear movement largely under the banner of the “freeze,” challenges one aspect or another of the deterrence strategy and demands a deemphasis on, if not the complete elimination of, nuclear weapons. Both of these positions, I believe, are flawed and fail to provide a satisfactory solution to the difficult situation in which the United States finds itself in the closing decades of the twentieth century.",Political Science and Politics,1984,17,1,18-23,"Gilpin, Robert G.",Princeton University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016639516,0,

L’auteure identifie et analyse brièvement les facteurs qui occasionnent le retard dans la construction du mouvement indépendant, soit : le consensus des Français concernant « leur » force de frappe, le rôle joué par le Parti communiste français dans le mouvement de la paix, l’attitude de l’Église catholique favorable à la dissuasion nucléaire, et la timidité des syndicats à s’engager dans la lutte pour le désarmement. De concert avec les autres groupes indépendants européens, le CODENE continue toutefois à promouvoir la réflexion sur le non-alignement et s’apprête à lancer une enquête-référendum nationale auprès des Français, concernant la modernisation de l’armement en France. A new non-aligned peace movement existes in France: ""le CODENE"" which is independent of the more traditional peace movement sympathetic to the Communists. The author discusses the reasons why an independent peace movement has been slow to take hold in France. Factors discussed include: the consensus in France concerning their ""own"" nuclear strike capacity, the role of the French Communist Party in the peace movement, the attitude of the Catholic Church generally favourable to a policy of nuclear deterrence and the reluctance of trade unions to get involved in the struggle for disarmament. Along with other non-aligned European peace movements, the CODENE continues to encourage discussion on non-alignment and is organizing a national referendum/survey concerning a modernization of defense policy in France. Un nuevo movimiento de paz independiente, el CODENE, existe en Francia, distinto del movimiento más tradicional y más próximo al comunismo. El autor identifica y analiza brevemente los factores que retrasan la construcción de este movimiento independiente: el consenso de los franceses respecto a ""su"" fuerza de intervención, el rol que ha jugado el Partido Comunista en el movimiento por la paz, la actitud de la iglesia católica, favorable a la disuasión nuclear, y la timidez de los sindicatos para implicarse en la lucha por el desarmamento.

pub.1021097864,10.1080/00323268308401884,The moral acceptability of nuclear deterrence: A critique,"Theorists within the just war tradition of ethics differ in their conclusions about nuclear warfare and nuclear deterrence. This paper examines three arguments for the conditional moral acceptability of nuclear deterrence—those of the U.S. National Conference of Catholic Bishops in their pastoral letter, of J. Bryan Hehir, and of Michael Walzer—and argues that none of the three constitutes intellectually compelling and practically useful moral advice. The bishops fail to convince us that nuclear use can ever fulfil the requirements of proportionality, and therefore that the intention to use nuclear weapons can ever be justified. Hehir fails to convince us that nuclear deterrence policies in fact distinguish categorically between intention and use. Walzer's case that deterrence is bad but necessary is more convincing but it, like Hehir's, does not constitute coherent moral advice for the citizen, soldier or government official. I conclude that, given the inadequacy of attempts to justify nuclear deterrence, even conditionally, we have a strong moral obligation to pursue alternatives.The level of citizen concern about the dangerous possibility of nuclear war has become greatly heightened in Europe and the United States in the 1980s. This is probably due to at least three factors: the significant technological developments in nuclear weaponry that have occurred during the last decade, the increased fear of Soviet military strength, and the concentration of recent U.S. administrations on developing and improving a nuclear war‐fighting capability. But even before the growth of the peace movement since 1980, a ‘new debate’ about the morality of nuclear weapons and deterrence policy had begun in academic and theological circles. In this paper, I will analyze three arguments of moral philosophers and theologians, all working within the ‘just war’ tradition, about whether nuclear deterrence, in any form, can be morally justified.",Australian Journal of Political Science,1983,18,2,16-26,"Okin, Susan Moller",Brandeis University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021097864,2,"[Thompson, Dennis F.]|[]|American Political Science Review|1980|74|4|905-916|10.2307/1954312|pub.1023105522|258;[Ball, Desmond]|[]|International Security|1982|7|3|31|10.2307/2538550|pub.1069980251|30;[Scoville, Herbert]|[]|Foreign Policy|1974||14|164|10.2307/1147955|pub.1102456272|8;[Sigal, Leon V.]|[ur.015301064373.87]|Foreign Policy|1979||34|35|10.2307/1148517|pub.1102456721|5;[Voorst, L.

However, most philosophical concern centers around the morality of nuclear deterrence. It is sometimes thought that the doctrine of just war can provide a moral justification for nuclear deterrence based on threats of massive retaliation. Yet attempts to apply the doctrine of just war lead to a moral dilemma: although nuclear deterrence seems justified as self-defense, there are compelling reasons for concluding that threats of retaliation are immoral. Alternative deterrence policies might be thought to overcome the moral dilemma. However, counterforce strategy and antimissile defense, as recently proposed by President Reagan, must still depend upon immoral threats of retaliation. Proposals for a nonviolent national defense offer a possible solution, and serious attention should be given to claims that nonviolent defense would deter aggression.",The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1983,469,1,46-57,"CHURCHILL, ROBERT P.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024067499,2,"[Schelling, Thomas C.]|[]|Theories of Peace and Security|1970|||64-84|10.1007/978-1-349-15376-3_4|pub.1006616728|5;[Rédei, George P.]|[]|Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics|2008|||951-951|10.1007/978-1-4020-6754-9_8160|pub.1043845707|8642;[Wells, Donald A.]|[]|The Journal of Philosophy|1969|66|23|819|10.2307/2023832|pub.1069703220|15;[Kavka, Gregory S.]|[]|The Journal of Philosophy|1978|75|6|285|10.2307/2025707|pub.1069704352|39;[Wolff, Robert P.]|[]|Social Theory and Practice|1970|1|1|99-111|10.5840/soctheorpract1970117|pub.1073250879|5;[Coates, A.

More and better of everything is clearly no answer; but it is not axiomatic that less is always more secure. Indeed the danger with small nuclear forces is that even marginal alternation in agreed-upon numbers can create a possibly decisive difference in the real balance of power. Nor does a defensive strategy—specifically the use of antiballistic missile systems—offer the technological panacea to render nuclear weapons obsolete. All systems leak; the question is, How badly?

While it is recognized that an adequate assessment of concrete arms control options and proposals may only be accomplished on the basis of more or less detailed combat simulations, elementary mathematical models of combat do provide important insights into the nature of conventional force equilibria and their stability. Based on an analysis of solutions of Lanchester’s model of modern combat it is shown that for force structures of antagonists which are equally capable of defence and attack, the legitimate desire for security must lead to arms races. However, if the assumption holds that a successful defence requires comparatively less military potential than a successful attack, defence-oriented concepts should permit to design military forces representing stable equilibria. Under certain conditions it should even be possible to attain crisis stability through a uni-lateral re-structuring of the conventional forces in a strictly defence-oriented manner.",IFAC Proceedings Volumes,1983,16,17,205-211,"Avenhaus, R.; Fichtner, J.; Huber, R.K.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1086293308,4,"[Leipholz, H.; Langhaar, H.

pub.1013473850,10.1007/bf00597981,The culture of peace and peace education,"In the present world situation, there is an urgent need for new strategies of peace based on the common fundamental interest of mankind, rejecting the use of force, and aimed at creating a new world order. Recognising the close interrelationship between culture and peace, and the extension of international interdependencies in reducing economic disparities, emphasis must be given to developing positive attitudes to peace in the minds of all men: a qualitative change in thinking has to occur before international security can be ensured without resort to military alliances and nuclear deterrence. The dangers inherent in the arms race require that education for disarmament be an integral part of peace education. Likewise, the connections between peace and other international objectives such as development and human rights, need to be stressed. Peace education should lead not only to a greater awareness of problems but also to a sense of responsibility and an active involvement in efforts towards promoting equal rights, economic and social development, and mutual respect and understanding among nations. The power of informed public opinion, internationally, in influencing governments towards peace and disarmament should not be underestimated; therefore, greater attention in peace education needs to be given to identifying and overcoming the structural, conceptual and cultural obstacles to peace. What is being undertaken in Romania, especially amongst young people, by way of education and action for peace, reflects a coherent policy, comprises a powerful and effective educational whole, and is contributing towards the building up of an international ‘constituency’ of peace and disarmament.",International Review of Education,1983,29,3,391-401,"NĂstase, Adrian",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013473850,2,

First, the balance-of-power theory is proven to be amorphous with respect to power distribution, system level and the equilibrating process which it purports to denote. Disequilibrium easily enters into the common usage of balance, from which the ideology of balance derives. Provided with equilibrium or a modicum of disequilibrium, propositions could be empirically tested. But a description of the existing distribution of power or significant disequilibrium would not be subjected toempirical but practical tests. Second, the methodology of a number of statistical and empirical tests are analyzed and proven to be deficient in any operationalizable concept of “power balance, ” even though this should be central to the theory. Third, practical tests are carried out with respect to the attitudes of H. J. Morgenthau, J. H. Herz, H. A. Kissinger, K. N. Waltz and M. A. Kaplan toward the balance of power, nuclear deterrence, the Vietnam War and Nazism. While nuclear deterrence theory is inclined to be accepted by protagonists of the military balance without taking into account humane considerations, it is more or less rejected by those who lay greater stress on the political connotation of balance, however loosely defined. Considering the above, readers abroad might well cast doubt on the validity of this research to the peace and war problems faced by Japan. A few additional remarks may illuminate the peace orientation behind this paper. The principle of balance-of-power is not only very popular, but also most ambiguous, among Japanese statesmen and political scientists. As shown here, it is inherently composed of concepts which cannot be strictly defined and verified. Besides, Japanese politics has scarcely experienced the principle's application. Modern Japan could not afford to make political use of this principle, being a nascent imperialist power before 1945. Contemporary Japan has established military forces under the guise of the so-called Self-Defence Forces, without giving any consideration to the political connotation of the principle, despite years of diplomatic inactivity since 1945. The peace movements and “peace thought” in post-war Japan have also been somewhat ignorant of political realism. To reap the harvest of our peace-orientation, this study, peace-oriented but conscious of political realism, aims to act as a fertilizer for regional and world peace.",International Relations,1983,1983,74,"15-36,l6","HATSUSE, Ryuhei",Kobe University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115121016,0,

No other country in the world has a defence policy involving all of the following three elements of reliance on nuclear weapons: (i) formal military alliance with a nuclear power (the NATO alliance with the USA); (ii) nuclear bases and facilities of an allied state (USA) situated on its territory; and (iii) possession of its own nuclear weapons and delivery systems of various types.

Then, as the number of nations with nuclear weapons increases, the chance of bilateral conflict becoming nuclear initially increases and then decreases to zero when all nations are nuclearly armed. Empirical evidence suggests that nuclear deterrence does in fact work in the way the model assumes. We set forth an expected utility model for initiating conflict when nuclear weapons are held by both sides, by one side, and by neither side.

Although the problem of the credibility of the American nuclear deterrence when extended to the protection of its Allies has existed since the beginning of the 1960s it has intensified with the SALT negotiations and treaties.

Particularly in the years since 1960 the academic and analytical journal literature has contained literally many hundreds of papers dealing with the subjects of nuclear 'deterrence', 'mutual assured destruction', etc. For the most part, these papers have demonstrated a pervasive and thorough ignorance of the actual state of planning regarding the potential use of these weapons. If anything, that segment of the research community most interested in arms control has shown itself to be particularly poorly informed, and most resistant to giving up its misconceptions. These critics sought the maintenance of a fictional status quo. Ironically critics on the 'right' who have consistently sought increased strategic nuclear war-fighting policies have falsely portrayed the official policies in exactly the same way so as to press for changes. The following paper is designed to provide official information regarding US nuclear weapon targeting in the hope of redressing this pervasive misunderstanding. The paper can only deal with the nuclear targeting policy of the United States. The paper is intended to do no more than to provide this information, in the hope of setting the record straight. It demonstrates that at least since 1960, US nuclear weapon targeting has always been primarily counter-military — 'counterforce' — and not directed in the first instance against the cities of the USSR. These military targets have always and primarily been the nuclear weapon systems of the USSR, including hardened missile silos as these were developed by the USSR.",Journal of Peace Research,1981,18,4,309-317,"Leitenberg, Milton",Swedish Institute of International Affairs,Sweden,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1054022909,2,

It is also widely believed that one or more Arab states will come into atomic possession within a 10 to 15 year time frame. The present analysis explores the consequences of the establishment of a regional mini-balance of terror. The central hypothesis is that apocalyptic images and doomsday visions have been accepted too readily and out of proportion to the arguments that are given, and that a stable system of mutual deterrence may be viable in the Middle East and may make a positive contribution to the process of political settlement. Problems of rationality, credibility, second-strike force survivability, escalation, tactical nuclear weapons, accidents, permissive action links, terrorism, preventive war, and the disclosure of nuclear weapons possession are discussed.",American Political Science Review,1977,71,4,1367-1383,"Rosen, Steven J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004780886,5,"[Willrich, Mason; Taylor, Theodore B.]|[; ]|Survival|1974|16|4|186-191|10.1080/00396337408441490|pub.1001689326|26;[Zahlan, A.

pub.1041664127,10.1080/03050627708434474,Fusing the international system: Notes on regional and global integration processes,The relationship between regional integration and global integration is rarely attempted by scholars perhaps because the former appears to have had little impact upon the latter. Those who do examine the theoretical aspects of the relationship are inclined to argue that regional integration is dysfunctional for global integration because it may lead to interregional conflict. There is also the argument that the more unified regions become the more likely will there arise a lack of interest in global collaboration. On the other hand it is possible that in the next twenty‐five to fifty years an array of regionally unified blocs could function cooperatively on the basis of a system of regional coexistence supported by inter‐regional nuclear deterrence. This may not promote global integration but it could contribute to a semblance of order in a future global system.,International Interactions,1977,3,4,369-374,"Yalem, Ronald J.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041664127,0,"[Haas, Ernst B.]|[ur.016244122251.30]|International Organization|1961|15|3|366-392|10.1017/s0020818300002198|pub.1015210035|241;[Masters, Roger D.]|[]|American Political Science Review|1961|55|4|780|10.2307/1952527|pub.1069666793|5"

Interdiction programs intended to stem the flow of drugs and aliens have been relatively unsuccessful. The cost of drug use and illegal aliens creates crushing financial burdens on our federal, state, and local governments, as well as on individuals. Maritime law enforcement interdiction operations more closely approximate military operations than conventional law enforcement. Military deterrence theory, both nuclear and conventional, is well researched and documented. This research has identified the elements which create conventional military deterrence. Through comparison of the elements of conventional military deterrence to maritime law enforcement interdiction we can identify shortcomings in creating deterrence in maritime law enforcement interdiction. Application of conventional military deterrence theory to maritime law enforcement interdiction can improve our understanding of the methods and tools necessary to create deterrence in maritime smuggling.",,,,,,"Nimmich, Joseph L.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091742516,0,

Thus, the chief challenge of this essay is to determine whether freezing in place the current state of nuclear ambiguity (i.e.. non-weaponized deterrence) is compatible with crisis stability.

This paper will look at the definition, theory and strategy of nuclear deterrence as it served the United States throughout the Cold War, and will discuss its viability for the future. Although chemical and biological weapons are now generally linked together with nuclear weapons into the category of Weapons of Mass Destruction, this paper addresses only the nuclear weapons issue. It is certainly conceivable that chemical and biological weapons and their delivery systems will soon provide their potential users with the destructive capability equivalent to nuclear weapons. It is also true that their acquisition and use provide many advantages over nuclear weapons Nuclear weapons, however, are distinct from these other weapons because of their demonstrated capability to produce instantaneous destruction on a massive scale and the mystique which has grown around them as a result of the central and unique role they played in the last 45 years of superpower competition known as the Cold War. Because we have been living with nuclear weapons as legitimate instruments of war we have developed definitive attitudes, policies and prejudices concerning them.",,,,,,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091740304,0,
pub.1091578942,10.21236/ada329263,After the Gulf War: Balancing Spacepower's Development.,"Early military applications of space-based assets bore little resemblance to their successful use in ""the first information war."" The US developed most of its early space systems to serve the Cold War nuclear deterrence strategy. The need to protect space sources and methods resulted in a high degree of secrecy and organizational compartmentalization. As a result, when Desert Shield began the highly fragmented leadership of the space community lacked coherent doctrine, operated with an inherited top-down ""technology push"" for system requirements, and had little spacepower experience. Spacepower was simply unprepared to support the theater Commander-in-Chief in other than the Cold War strategic role. The experiences of the Persian gulf War confirmed these characteristics-the majority of the documented lessons concerned a lack of doctrine or a lack of space literacy/experience. In the development of spacepower, doctrine and experience have evolved much more slowly than the pace of technology. In the interim, have the US participants redressed the imbalance that existed in the development of spacepower as witnessed in Operation Desert Shield/Storm? At issue for space policy makers is the question of whether or not reform in technology, experience, or doctrine will move the US Military Space Program toward a more robust warfighting capability.",,,,,,"Gallegos, Frank",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091578942,0,

This Cold War relationship was essentially ""The Grand Bargain"", whereby the United States provided nuclear deterrence and an overarching security umbrella for Western Europe, in return for being allowed to call the shots. It persists despite a radically changed security environment prompted by the two most dramatic phenomena of the old century's last decade--the abrupt, peaceful end to the Cold War and the acceleration of worldwide interconnectedness known as ""globalization."" Within Europe itself, much has changed since Eastern Europe's ""velvet revolutions,"" the collapse of the Berlin wall, and the consignment of the Soviet Union to history's dustbin. The most salient events revolve around integration in Western Europe and disintegration in southeastern Europe. The half century-old process of ""building Europe,"" propelled forward by the Maastricht Treaty, has continued apace, deepening economic and political ties among European Union (EU) members, as they simultaneously took the first small steps to forge their own security and defense policy. The Balkan ""troubles""--the bloody wars of Yugoslav succession--revealed fissures among transatlantic allies, a seeming European inability to act concertedly or decisively in their own ""backyard"" absent American leadership, and a substantial gap between US and European military capabilities.",,,,,,"Cate, Alan; Chappell, Carl; Suttie, Richard; Vietti, Kevin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091535440,0,
pub.1091567339,10.21236/ada505236,The Interagency Cometh: Is the National Security System of 1947 Capable of Handling the Challenges of 2009?,"Despite the complexity of the Contemporary Operating Environment, the United States is still wedded to a national security system created in 1947. The United States places itself in jeopardy by using a system created at the end of World War II for a world where state actors were the primary threat, with the Soviet Union, the Cold War, and nuclear deterrence taking center stage. The National Security Council (NSC) is no longer capable of efficiency. The advisory body created by congress and President Truman has been overcome in recent years by the complex environment evolving from the end of the Cold War. The NSC's efficiency began to falter in Vietnam, and its failed policies have resulted in numerous interagency failures throughout the last 40 years. Compounding the issues at the national policy planning level is the current regional policy execution system. The United States has militarized its foreign policy. It has done so out of circumstance vice design. The evolution of the Department of Defense since 1949 has led it to create Geographic Combatant Commands, which are staffed and capable of regional policy execution. Recent inclusion of other agency personnel into the commands to enable them to plan in an 'interagency' fashion has given them even more capability to act as the regional foreign policy arm of the United States. Adding to this militarization of policy execution is the lack of regional capability within the Department of State. The evolution of the State Department has led it to create an ambassador-centric organization, which engages single countries in diplomacy instead of approaching diplomacy regionally. Without a systemic change at national and regional levels, the United States runs the risk of improperly identifying future problems, and creating policy that when implemented may exacerbate global tensions.",,,,,,"Halvorson, Robert D.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091567339,0,
pub.1091576003,10.21236/ada490689,"Strategy for the Long Haul: The U.S. Defense Industrial Base, Past, Present and Future","The emergence, during the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower, of a peacetime defense industry of significant proportions was an unprecedented event in the history of the American republic. Two geopolitical developments made its emergence more or less unavoidable for a nation committed to leadership of the Free World after World War II. One was the onset of the US-Soviet Cold War in the late 1940s and the formulation, in response, of the strategy of trying to contain Soviet power. The other was North Korea's invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which precipitated the large increases in defense spending called for in Paul Nitze's formulation of containment in April 1950. The standing military-industrial complex that these developments brought into being endures to this day. Since the 1950s, the US defense industrial base has been a source of long-term strategic advantage for the United States, just as it was during World War II. American defense companies provided the bombers and missiles on which nuclear deterrence rested and armed the US military with world-class weapons, including low-observable aircraft, wide-area surveillance and targeting sensors, and reliable guided munitions cheap enough to be employed in large numbers. They also contributed to the development of modern digital computers, successfully orbited the first reconnaissance satellites, put a man on the moon in less than a decade, and played a pivotal role in developing the worldwide web. Critics have long emphasized President Eisenhower's warning in his farewell television address that the nation needed to ""guard against the acquisition of undue influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.""",,,,,,"Watts, Barry D.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091576003,0,
