There are multiple studies of nuclear doctrine in relation to each country, yet this article tries to connect them in the sense of consiring the possible influence of Moscow’s nuclear doctrine on Beijing. In doing this, the author examines the nature of the growing ‘strategic partnership’ between Russia and China to include tracing its origins, limits, and ambiguity and the speculative question of an emerging ‘de facto alliance’. It outlines the growth in military-to-military contacts, developing joint military exercises both bilateral and multilateral, as well as Moscow’s decision to involve China in its annual strategic level military exercises, contrasting Vostok 2010 and Vostok 2018. Indeed, there is a policy perception in Western government circles, particularly in the United States, that should war erupt with Russia that the latter will find itself alone; this is certainly open to question and potentially a dangerous oversight in Washington policy circles, as well as among its allies. The article also raises important questions concerning Moscow’s continued adherence to the undeclared nuclear policy of ‘escalate-to-de-escalate’ and its further strengthening of the conventional level of ‘pre-nuclear’ deterrence. In essence, this article raises questions of interest in the policy and scholarly communities, rather than proving concrete conclusions. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,"McDermott, R.N.; Department of War Studies, Strand, United Kingdom; email: rogermcdermott@kcl.ac.uk",,,"Routledge",,,,,13518046,,,,"English","J.

In this context nuclear weapons look set to remain a permanent feature of the international strategic landscape, making it critical that developments undermining nuclear deterrence and strategic stability are interrogated. This chapter does this in four stages. First, it outlines the evolution of nuclear deterrence theory during the Cold War, and how changes after the Cold War led to a reconceptualization of deterrence theory and strategy by the United States. Second, it shows that a raft of emerging technologies, including ballistic missiles defenses, cyber technologies, Artificial Intelligence and social media, are undermining the foundations of nuclear deterrence and strategic stability. Third, it explains why contemporary international politics is not conducive to the nuclear disarmament agenda, as great power competition escalates between the U.S. and China, and U.S. and Russia. It concludes by asserting that the arms control regime must be reconfigured to address the most destabilising features of the contemporary security environment. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,,,,,,,,"Allison, G., (1971) Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis, , Little Brown, Boston; (2018) Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), , https://www.atomi-cheritage.org/history/strategic-defense-initiative-sdi, July 10, Accessed 4 Sep 2019; Altmann, J., Sauer, F., Autonomous weapon systems and strategic stability (2017) Survival, 59 (5), pp. 117-142; Beres, L.R., Tilting toward Thanatos: America’s ‘Countervailing’ nuclear strategy (1981) World Polit, 34 (1), pp. 25-46. , October; Bracken, P., The cyber threat to nuclear stability (2016) Orbis, 60 (2), pp. 188-203; Buckley, N., Jones, S., Russia, H.K., Putting the ‘Nuclear Gun’ back on the table (2016) Financial Times, , https://www.ft.com/content/03dfeb98-aa88-11e6-9cb3-bb8207902122?mhq5j=e5, November, Accessed 26 Apr 2019; Bush, G.W., (2002) The National Security Strategy of the United States of America, , https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/national/nss-020920.htm, September 2002, Accessed 26 Apr 2019; Caldwell, D., Williams, R.E., Jr., (2016) Seeking Security in an Insecure World, , Rowman & Littlefield, Lanham; Cimbala, S.J., McDermott, R.N., A new cold war?

Russia’s cyber defense includes the protection of critical information infrastructure and increasing digital sovereignty by improving the readiness and capabilities to isolate the Russian segment of the Internet from the global Internet. Yet a credible defense also requires credible deterrence. The traditional deterrence options are deterrence by punishment, deterrence by denial and deterrence by entanglement. Deterrence by punishment is based on a defender’s capability to retaliate. Deterrence by denial means that a defender is capable to limit damages by denial attacker´s success. Deterrence by entanglement is based on nations’ mutual interest and their political, economic, and strategic interdependence. An effective deterrence strategy has to be credible, based on capability and send the right message to a possible adversary. Credibility means that the state displays the willingness to counteract an attack, and capability means that the state has the tools to do so. Cyber warfare differs from warfare in other domains because actors in cyber conflicts are not always military actors. State actors, criminals, and terrorists attack state authorities, media, and critical infrastructure. The attribution of an attack to a specific party is often difficult or impossible to do. An attacker in cyberspace can act with deniability, impunity, and anonymity. Traditional deterrence is difficult or impossible to implement in cyberspace because denial can be too difficult and there is no possiblity to identify an attacker for retaliation. The strategic option of cyber deterrence is an active cyber defense, which is a combination of deterrence by denial and deterrence bypunishment. This paper discuss Russian active cyber defense, which combines defensive and offensive cyber capabilties. In its theoretical context, this paper is based on the theory of deterrence and the theory of strategic culture. The theory of deterrence is used to describe how Russia constructs its cyber deterrence. The theory of strategic culture seeks to explain Russia’s motives for these choices. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

The second nuclear age, following the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union, poses new challenges with respect to nuclear-strategic stability, deterrence and nonproliferation. The spread of nuclear weapons in Asia, and the potential for new nuclear weapons states in the Middle East, create new possible axes of conflict potentially stressful to the existing world order. Other uncertainties includethe interest of major powers in developing a wider spectrum of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, possibly for use in limited nuclear wars, and the competitive technologies for antimissile defenses being developed and deployed by the United States and Russia. Other technology challenges, including the implications of cyberwar for nuclear deterrence and crisis management, are also considered. Political changes also matter. The early post-Cold War hopes for the emergence of a global pacific security community, excluding the possibility of major war, have been dashed by political conflict between Russia and NATO, by the roiled nature of Americandomestic politics with respect to international security, and by a more assertive and militarily competent China.

Yet, despite extensive reductions in nuclear weapons stockpiles since the Cold War peaks, nuclear arms control and disarmament efforts are currently in disarray. After the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was terminated in 2019, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty remains as the only bilateral limitation on United States (US) and Russian nuclear forces in operation and is due to expire in February 2021. The US has justified its limited nuclear disarmament progress on the premise that the current international security environment is not conducive to further nuclear disarmament. Instead, the US has recently promoted a new initiative called Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND). The initiative aims to provide a platform for all States to engage in constructive dialogue to identify ways to improve the international security envir-onment, which make nuclear deterrence necessary while addressing the hurdles that currently impede progress towards nuclear disarmament. Significantly, the US regards CEND as an ‘effective measure’ and an illustration of its commitment towards disarmament under Article VI. This article seeks to address the US claim that CEND represents a good faith, effective measure towards nuclear disarmament pursuant to Article VI. This will revisit existing doctrinal interpretative debates concerning the obligation under Article VI, particu-larly the requirements that negotiations and measures be adopted in good faith, and what constitutes an effective measure towards nuclear disarmament. The discussion will then determine whether the CEND initiative itself can be considered a good faith, effective measure towards nuclear disarmament, by considering its purpose, origins and implementation, and actions of the US. © 2020 The Author.","CEND; Disarmament; Good faith; NPT; Nuclear weapons",,,,,,"Arts and Humanities Research Council, AHRC","108.

It may lead to an uncontrolled multilateral arms race involving strategic, intermediate-range, tactical nuclear and non-nuclear offensive and defensive weapons. This dangerous turn of events is met with different attitude by different politicians and experts. One expanding school of thought postulates that the bipolar world of the Cold War era has given way to multipolarity, so bilateral nuclear weapons restrictions are no longer feasible. This assumption is supplemented by a hypothesis that it is impossible to control the newest weapons and military technologies using previous methods of negotiations and agreements, so those methods should also be abandoned. The focus should allegedly shift to various multilateral forums on creating an environment for nuclear disarmament and enhancing nuclear deterrence, transparency and predictability. Thus, the main premise is that the current arms control crisis is unavoidable and does not pose much danger: it is possible to do without formal nuclear arms reduction, limitation and non-proliferation agreements. However, scientific analysis demonstrates that the above assumptions about the advent of nuclear multipolarity and effects of new technologies are wrong. Firstly, despite deep reductions in nuclear weapons over the last 30 years, the proportion of those controlled by the two leading nuclear powers has barely declined at all, and the nuclear landscape remains largely bilateral. Secondly, the revolutionary impact of military technological progress is not something new, but is a logical phenomenon that has occurred regularly throughout history. Nonetheless, five decades of experience clearly demonstrated that arms control can be very successful, provided there is political will at the highest governments’ level to reach agreements on limitation and reduction of nuclear weapons. Like in the past, in the foreseeable future, arms control measures are able to substantially reduce the threat posed by innovative weapons systems. No doubt, arms control agreements do have their limits. But overall, despite certain gaps and failures, the arms control process has scored a number of historical victories during the past 50 years, and it should remain at the core of international security, even if many problems cannot be resolved quickly or all at once. Only the continuation of nuclear arms control can create political and military conditions for eventual limitations of many innovative weapons systems and technologies, as well as for a phased shift to a multilateral format of nuclear disarmament. © 2020, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The decision to carry out this type of strike can be made within a few minutes based on data from an early warning system. Since there is no way to completely rule out the possibility of errors in generation of that data, the main focus in the concept of nuclear deterrence should be made on the retaliation strike. This strike posture has always been used as a rationale for the composition of Strategic Rocket Force and Navy forces which focus on ensuring that weapons can survive a disarmament first strike from a potential adversary. This would allow more time for decision-making regarding the use of nuclear forces; therefore, due to the increased vulnerability of informational systems, the principles of a retaliation strike should be given more attention in planning operations involving strategic nuclear forces. Early warning systems should be used first and foremost for the global monitoring of missile and carrier rocket launches, i.e. monitoring accidental (unintended) and provocative missile launches, as well as for assessing nations’ compliance with the Missile Technology Control Regime. © 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

One of them is “neo-hawks”, who are claiming that disarmament agreements are detrimental by hindering the development of new nuclear arms, which have once again become an effective tool of policy and war after deep reductions during the last thirty years. These experts advocate new programs of nuclear, conventional, and dual purpose weapon systems and elaborate strategic concepts of limited nuclear warfare, controlled escalation, and victory in a nuclear war. Another school – “ide-alists” who call for ending with nuclear weapons by a single grand treaty of the kind they managed to promote in the UN in 2017 – the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The third school is “revisionists” who argue that nuclear multipolarity, proliferation and new military technologies (hypersonic missiles, cyber warfare, long-range armed drones, space weapons, etc.) have made traditional arms control outdated. They propose to revise the notions of parity and strategic stability, the practice of nuclear arms reductions and limitations, numerical ceilings and meticulous verification procedures. As a replacement they promote the idea of various multilateral dialogues with the goal of enhancing mutual nuclear deterrence, predictability, and trust among nations. A closer scrutiny demonstrates extreme danger of the first type of thinking which is leading to a nuclear war. The second school’s idea, for all good intentions of its authors, is impossible to implement. It mistakenly treats nuclear disarmament as a technical issue, while it is an extremely complex political and strategic problem. The third group may do still more harm by persuading state leaders and public opinion that the collapse of the arms control is not dangerous: allegedly it is possible to enhance security without long and exhausting negotiations and complex agreements. In contrast to the above ideas, provided political will of the leaderships of the major nations, it is still possible to save or revive some important treaties and move forward addressing many novel weapons and technologies by arms control talks. Dynamic changes of the world order, military hard-and software, and strategic thinking – all these are making arms control more vital for the Russian and international security than ever before. © 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Important aspects of the evolving or, better to say, ""digital-technological"" race, which influence strategic stability, may have a profound effect on the character, model, scales, instruments of arms deterrence, and on the perspectives of the arms control system as a whole. The main hypothesis of the work is as follows. High dynamics of the innovation-digital development is one of the key factors which determine the inevitability of the appearance of a new conceptual approach to the arms control and new forms of deterrence. The last, for an example, may be called a hybrid deterrence, including asymmetric threats deterrence, cyber deterrence, deterrence in space and deterrence by denial. The necessity to consider revolutionary and incremental innovations as important elements of national military power and international security is noted. Special attention is given to the perspectives of development and use of Big Data, automation, quantum computers, artificial intelligence, including such transforming, so-called ""traditional"" (incremental) technologies as hypersonic vehicles (for example). Interactions and integrations of the revolutionary and evolutional technologies in their influence on strategic stability and different sorts of arms deterrence are on the rise. It is suggested that such circumstances, with increasing complexity and a systemic character of the strategic deterrence environment, may lead to formation of the united universal arms deterrence in the future. The main characters of this universal system would be the eroding borders between different deterrence types and transfer of tasks between them: for instance, between nuclear and conventional weapons. © 2019 Russian Academy of Sciences.","Access lock; Access systems; Arms control; Asymmetry; Balances; Deterrence; Digitalization; Drones; Innovation; National and international security; Strategic stability",,,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 18-18-00463","(World Economy and International Relations, 2019, vol. 63, no. 6, pp. 70-83) Received 21.11.2018.

This NATO approach advanced cohesion among allies, some of which were politically uncomfortable with if not borderline opposed to nuclear deterrence. Allied comfort is now under siege, however. Russian military doctrine threatens the early use of nuclear weapons, and states such as Iran and North Korea expose fault lines in the nuclear arms control regime that in recent years has sought to further the full abolition of nuclear weapons. NATO finds itself challenged by the twin requirements of ensuring credible deterrence and meeting the concerns of Alliance members who thought reliance on nuclear weapons was a thing of the past. © 2019, The Editor of the Journal.","Deterrence; Doctrine; INF; NATO; No-first-use; Nuclear; Russia; START; Strategic",,,,,,,,,"Record, J., (1974) US Nuclear Weapons in Europe: Issues and Alternatives, p. 8. , The Brookings Institution, Washington; Leitenberg, M., Background Materials in Tactical Nuclear Weapons (Primarily in the European Context) (1978) Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Tactical Nuclear Weapons: European Perspectives, p. 16. , London, Taylor and Francis Ltd; O’Neill, K., Building the Bomb (1998) Atomic Audit, , Schwartz Stephen I, (ed), Brookings, Washington, DC; Kristensen, H.M., (2005) U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe: A Review of Post-Cold War Policy, Force Levels, and War Planning, p. 24. , Washington, DC, Natural Resources Defence Council; Norris, R.S., Kristensen, H.M., Paine, C.E., Insecurity, N., (2004) A Critique of the Bush Administration’s Nuclear Weapons Policies, p. 2. , Natural Resources Defence Council, Washington, DC; Freedman, L., (2003) The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy, , 3, Palgrave Macmillan, New York; Gunnar, A., Charles, T., (2003) Russia’s Tactical Nuclear Weapons, Part I: Background and Policy Issues, , https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/7912/thorntonrussia.pdf;sequence=1, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Report FOI-R--1057—SE, November 2003, Accessed 15 Oct 2018; Larsen, J.A., (1991) The Politics of NATO Short-Range Nuclear Modernization 1983–1990: The Follow-On to Lance Missile Decision, , Ph.D. Dissertation, Princeton University; Larsen, J., Klingenberger, K., (2001) Controlling Non-Strategic Nuclear Weapons: Obstacles and Opportunities, , (eds), Institute for National Security Studies, Colorado Springs, CO; (2001), Brussels: NATO Office of Information and Press; Alexander, B., Millar, A., (2003) Tactical Nuclear Weapons: Emergent Threats in an Evolving Security Environment, p. 190. , (eds), Brassey’s, Washington; Cirincione, J., Wolfsthal, J.B., Rajkumar, M., Arsenals, D., (2005) Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Threats, , 2, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, DC; Kristensen, H.M., (2012) Non-Strategic Nuclear Weapons, , https://fas.org/_docs/Non_Strategic_Nuclear_Weapons.pdf, Special Report No. 3.

The authors argue that these changes are consistent with the administration's wider â' peace through strength' approach that draws on traditional Republican thinking on security policy. While designed to demonstrate credibility and resolve to both allies and adversaries, however, this assertive approach to security policy and specifically nuclear policy as a necessary precursor to renewed engagement in strategic negotiations may have unintended consequences. This article focuses on European reactions to the strategy and argues that the Trump administration's nuclear posture challenges common European understandings in three principal areas. First, changes to US declaratory policy contest European assumptions on the role of nuclear weapons in defending NATO. Second, US modernization plans and their implications for intra-alliance relations risk accentuating controversial debates about the US commitment to Europe. Third, the apparent US rejection of arms control widens the scope for discord with European leaders. If European leaders assert a clear and credible alternative vision advocating nuclear restraint, risk reduction and arms control they could rebuild trust and confidence between the United States, NATO and Russia, demonstrating real strength and ultimately leading to more genuine opportunities for peace and sustainable European security. © 2019 The Author(s).

First, it corresponds with the real politik vision of world politics where the states engage in (zero-sum) competition for power and resources. Second, the new world order emerges because of a conflict between different models of development and value systems. These two observations highlight a certain “family resem-blance” between the current Russian assessment of the current security environment and the situation during the Cold War. Furthermore, Russian national security strategy is oriented toward achieving strategic stability with the other great powers. The maintenance of strategic parity (nuclear and conventional deterrence) is a means to this end. However, given Russia’s relative weakness in comparison to its major geopolitical competitors, this has led to the renewal of the Cold War-era concept of asymmetric approach. Although this concept is most often used in the context of nuclear deterrence and the debate on “strategic stability,” it is not about military security only. The set of asymmetric measures from economic dependence or sanctions, to diplomatic, political, and informational measures are used to prevent an emergence of a conflict that would threaten Russia’s sovereignty and domestic stability. The purpose of this paper is to explore the Soviet roots of Active Measures and how the Soviet heritage is present at both the theoretical level and in concrete practices. Finally, insights from the conceptual analysis are applied in assessing the vulnerability of the Nordic countries, in particular Finland and Sweden, to Russian influence operations. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Active Measures; Cold War; Finland; Reflexive control; Russian information influence; Soviet propaganda; Sweden",,,,,,,,,,"Pynnöniemi, K.; University of Helsinki, Aleksanteri institute, PL 42 (Unioninkatu 33), Finland; email: katri.pynnoniemi@helsinki.fi",,,"Routledge",,,,,09546553,,,,"English","Terrorism Polit.

However, although significant technological progress has been achieved in creating ballistic missile interception systems and global information network, over 60 years of experience in the development and flight testing have confirmed the impossibility of protecting the countries’ territory from massive nuclear strikes. It is possible to intercept only a single missile or an extremely small number of them. An objective analysis of the state and effectiveness of existing and potential future characteristics of missile defense systems suggests that their impact on the nuclear deterrence capability of Russia and the United States is virtually absent and does not hinder the negotiation processes aimed at limiting strategic offensive arms. That being said, missile defense systems have a potential to significantly affect regional stability and, depending on the situation, have both stabilizing and destabilizing effect on the military and political landscape. It is therefore incumbent upon the UN Security Council and other international organizations to continuously monitor regional stability in order to be able to react promptly and prevent negative development of the situation. © 2019, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Since great powers have always claimed spheres of influence, this raises the issue of what characteristics a Chinese sphere of influence might have. Currently, the Chinese sphere of influence is still rather fuzzy. But one might argue that North Korea is part of it. After all, the Chinese fought the Korean War in order to prevent all of Korea becoming part of the US sphere of influence. If one accepts that North Korea is part of the Chinese sphere of influence, then Kim Jong-un's nuclear weapons should become a Chinese concern instead of a US concern. If China wants a nuclear weapons power next door, and a joint missile defense effort by the United States, Japan, and South Korea because of it so be it. If China understands its national interest, as great powers have historically done, then it could undermine the North Korean regime more effectively than the United States could at much lower risks of escalation to a great war. Whereas the United States hesitates to recognize that North Korea is and should remain part of the Chinese sphere of influence, its economic sanctions against Russia risk driving Russia into China's arms. Focusing on the incipient rivalry between China and the United States for global primacy does in no way imply advocacy of a hawkish US policy towards China. In the nuclear age, peace between rival powers should depend on two pillars: nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence, or “peace by fear” and “peace by trade.”. © 2018 Center for International Studies, Inha University","China; North Korea; nuclear weapons; Russia; sanctions; spheres of influence; United States",,,,,,,,,"Allison, G., (2017) Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?, , Boston, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Auslin, M., Asia's Other Great Game (2017) National Interest, 152, pp. 10-24; Beckley, M., The Emerging Military Balance in East Asia: How China's Neighbors Can Check Chinese Naval Expansion (2017) International Security, 42 (2), pp. 78-119; Bernholz, P., (1985) The International Game of Power, , Berlin, Mouton; Besley, T., Kudamatsu, M., (2007) Development Economics Discussion Paper Series Paper 48, , http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/3764/1/Making_Autocracy_Work.pdf, “Making Autocracy Work,”,), at, (searched date 1 March 2018); Blackwill, R.D., Harris, J.M., (2016) War by Other Means: Geoeconomics and Statecraft, , Cambridge, Harvard University Press; Bleaney, M., Nishiyama, A., Explaining Economic Growth: A Contest Between Models (2002) Journal of Eonomic Growth, 7 (1), pp. 43-56; Bloom, D.E., Williamson, J.G., Demographic Transitions and Economic Miracles in Emerging Asia (1998) World Bank Economic Review, 12 (3), pp. 419-455; Clark, C., (2013) The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914, , London, Penguin; Collins, R., (1986) Weberian Sociological Theory, , New York, Cambridge University Press; Copeland, D.C., (2015) Economic Interdependence and War, , Princeton, Princeton University Press; Daalder, I.H., Responding to Russia's Resurgence (2017) Foreign Affairs, 96 (6), pp. 30-38; Dikötter, F., (2010) Mao's Great Famine: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1958–1962, , London, Bloomsbury; Doucouliagos, H., Ulubasoglu, M., Democracy and Economic Growth: A Meta-Analysis (2008) American Journal of Political Science, 52 (1), pp. 61-83; Early, B.R., Alliances and Trade with Sanctioned Sates: A Study of US Economic Sanctions, 1950-2000 (2012) Journal of Conflict Resolution, 56 (3), pp. 547-572; Economy, E.C., The Great Leap Backward?

However, the expectations from one side, practical commitment of allies from other side may not go in harmony and synchronisation. Is there a capability gap which needs to be fulfilled? If yes then, is the gap in the side of nuclear powers or is it on the side of those endangered states who need to understand what can or cannot realistically be expected?

During the last three decades, U.S. and Russian nuclear forces have been reduced by 6-7 times in warheads number, and strategic balance is more stable than it has ever been in the past 30 years in its classic sense - the mutual unfeasibility of a first (disarming) strike. However, the main present paradox is that the threat of nuclear war between the two leading powers is now higher than any time during the last three decades. Also the understanding of the notion of stability and nuclear deterrence by the two nations has diverged far apart. It is noteworthy that the main strategic document of Donald Trump's administration - ""Nuclear Posture Review"" of January 2018 - makes the nuclear stance of the two powers more symmetric. In contrast to the previous administration of Barack Obama, the new U.S. government is emphasizing the growing importance of nuclear arms and nuclear deterrence for American and international security. While the democrats were reducing reliance on nuclear deterrence and promoting long-range conventional defensive and offensive weapons, the republicans have approved a massive program of modernization of all legs of strategic triade, development of new sea-based and air-based nuclear cruise missiles and introduction of low-yield nuclear warheads. However, this new symmetry is not a guarantee for a new beginning of the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control dialogue or removal of the danger of nuclear war. The main threats of an armed conflict between the United States and Russia stem from several directions. One is the probability of an uncontrolled crisis escalation in Eastern Europe or Syria. Another is the possibility of the employment of conventional long-range precision-guided cruise and boost-glide missiles in attacking nuclear forces and command-control system of the opponent in line with the strategic concepts of ""conventional (or pre-nuclear) deterrence"". Yet another threat is the deployment and possible employment of low-yield nuclear weapons, which are assigned missions of selective nuclear strikes in line with the concept of conflict ""de-escalation"". In order to remove these dangers strategic arms control negotiations should be resumed as soon as possible and in the meanwhile existing treaties must be sustained. The juxtaposed Russian and NATO armed forces in the Eastern Europe should be disengaged and limited. New understanding of the notions of nuclear deterrence and strategic stability should be forged. © 2018 Nauka Publishing House.

Nuclear weapons supposedly had little or no remaining role to play in US security; the only real questions were how, and how quickly could the United States lead the world to nuclear disarmament. The end of the Cold War, which left the United States as the only standing Superpower inspired this view of history, nuclear deterrence, and nuclear weapons.

The U.S. recent policies increased the likelihood of a direct military confrontation between the two powers and of highly dangerous and rapidly escalating events comparable with the Cuban Missile Crisis. The paper emphasizes the significance of nuclear proliferation challenges and their negative impact on the U.S.-Russia strategic balance. Global strategic stability has been also undermined by a rapid development of various disruptive technologies and weapon systems including cyberwarfare and space warfare capabilities. The erosion of strategic stability takes place against the background of an ongoing complex transition from a unipolar world order to multipolarity. In order to effectively address multidimensional challenges of ensuring and strengthening strategic stability scholars and policymakers alike should focus on the U.S.-Russia strategic nuclear balance while taking into account the impact of the strategic ballistic missile defense systems, strategic non-nuclear weapons and tactical nuclear weapons. © 2018.","Arms control; Arms reductions; Crisis situations; Escalation; Strategic nonnuclear deterrence; Strategic nuclear deterrence; Strategic stability",,,,,,,,,"Akhromeev, S.F., Kornienko, G.M., Through the Eyes of the Marshal and Diplomat.

They provide explanation to the difference between the strategic stability and strategic balance concepts and stress the importance of the former concept for the creation of negotiating basis for interaction between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. in the period of Cold War in the course of achieving strategic parity and formation of ideological footage of the dialogue on the strategic weapons' reductions. The authors also evaluate the present and perspective factors that might undermine strategic as well as regional and transregional stabilities. The major focus is cast on the importance of unbiased approaches and science-based expertise for the compiling of urgent set of destabilizing factors. They prove by putting forward many factual arguments that the U.S. vastly disregard the destabilizing influence of their ABM systems on the contemporary geopolitical order. The article gives a verdict that the current U.S. and NATO security policies made the transit to the nonnuclear world completely impossible. At the same time, the authors perceive their major task in proposing the goal to outline the new tenets of strategic stability. They assess its new parameters on the global scope in the situation when this concept cannot be reduced to its narrow interpretation as the imperative of preventing the nuclear duel between the major nuclear states but should take into account all multiplicity of factors that define the security paradigms in the current world order realities. The authors also review the ongoing strategic modernization programs of the Russian strategic forces through the prism of their role in assuring the strategic stability and the protection of the country's vital national interests. © 2018.В статье дается ретроспективный анализ эволюции понятия и концепций стратегической стабильности - от стратегических концепций военной сферы в XIX в., в период холодной войны - и к концептуальной базе по созданию нового мироустройства в XXI в. Дается объяснение различия стратегического баланса и стратегической стабильности. Отмечается важность для формирования договорной основы взаимодействия СССР и США в годы холодной войны при достижении паритета и формировании понятийной базы диалога по сокращению стратегических вооружений. Авторы рассматривают имеющиеся и перспективные факторы, способные подорвать как стратегическую, так и региональную и трансрегиональную стабильность. Особое внимание уделяется роли непредвзятых подходов и научной экспертизы в формировании актуального перечня дестабилизирующих факторов. Аргументированно доказывается, что США не учитывают дестабилизирующую роль их программы ПРО в современной геополитической системе. В статье констатируется, что политика США и НАТО делает пока что невозможным переход к безъядерному миру. Вместе с тем своей главной целью авторы видят постановку задачи выработки новых основ стратегической стабильности, оценку ее новых параметров на глобальной основе, когда концепция уже не сводится к узкой трактовке как приоритет недопущения ядерного конфликта между крупнейшими ядерными державами, но должна учитывать всю совокупность факторов, определяющих парадигмы безопасности в современных реалиях миропорядка. Рассматриваются и нынешние программы модернизации стратегических сил России с точки зрения поддержания стратегической стабильности и защиты национальных интересов страны. © 2018.","ABM; Arms race; Military doctrine; Mutual assured destruction; Nuclear deterrence; Russia; START; Strategic stability; System of international relations; U.S.; Взаимное гарантированное уничтожение; Военная доктрина; Гонка вооружений; ПРО; Россия; СНВ; стратегическая стабильность; США; Ядерное сдерживание, система международных отношений",,,,,,,,,"Arbatov, A.G., Threats to Strategic Stability (2018) Imaginary and Real, (3), pp. 7-29. , https://doi.org/10.17976/jpps/2018.03.02, Polis.

It might be supposed that nuclear weapons, the ultimate weapons for mass destruction, and cyber conflicts, involving nonlethal and precisely targeted attacks on information systems and computer networks, would be polar opposites on the menu of military means. On the other hand, there is the potential for cyber attacks to be employed against command-control systems that enable nuclear weapons to perform their assigned missions. In addition, information warfare might be used during a nuclear crisis to mislead the opponent about another state’s intentions or capabilities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,"Libicki, M.C., The Convergence of Information Warfare (2017) Strategic Studies Quarterly, 11 (1), pp. 49-65; Singer, P.W., Friedman, A., (2014) Cybersecurity and Cyberwar:What Everyone Needs to Know, pp. 67-72. , Oxford University Press, New York; Baev, P.K., Corruption Spoils Every Attempt to Cooperate With Russia (2017) Eurasia Daily Monitor, , https://jamestown.org/analyst/pavel-k-baev, 17 July, accessed 7 August 2017; Thomas, T.L., (2015) Russia: Military Strategy Impacting 21st Century Reform and Geopolitics, pp. 253-299. , Foreign Military Studies Office, Fort Leavenworth, KS; Gartzke, E., Lindsay, J.R., Thermonuclear Cyberwar (2017) Journal of Cybersecurity, 13 (1), pp. 1-12; Futter, A., The Double-Edged Sword: US Nuclear Command and Control Modernization (2016) Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, , http://thebulletin.org/double-edged-sword-us-nuclear-command-and-control-modernization.html, 29 June; Futter, A., (2016) Cyber Threats and Nuclear Weapons: New Questions for Command and Control, Security and Strategy, , www.rusi.org, Royal United Service Institute for Defence and Security Studies, London, RUSI Occasional Paper, July; Futter, A., War Games Redux?

The question is all the more acute given that Russia has conducted a sweeping military modernization program since 2008, significantly improving its general-purpose forces and thereby seemingly reducing the need to rely on nuclear weapons. Yet Russia’s nonstrategic (also known as tactical) nuclear weapons continue to play a central role in its military doctrine–and if anything, the weapons’ role has increased in the post-Cold War security environment. Initially, they were viewed as a way of compensating for Russia’s military-technological inferiority after the collapse of the Soviet Union, giving the country some breathing space until Russia would have the wherewithal to boost its conventional power–especially in the research and development of high-precision conventional weapons that could be an alternative to nuclear munitions. Indeed, in recent years, Russia has increased its focus on developing nonnuclear deterrence capabilities. That said, NSNWs remain an integral element in the evolving Russian military strategy, combining a set of cross-domain deterrence options including strategic and nonstrategic nuclear, strategic conventional, and nonmilitary ways and means. © 2017 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.","military doctrine; military strategy; nonstrategic nuclear weapons; nuclear deterrence; Russia; tactical nuclear weapons",,,,,,,,,"Adamsky, D., Nuclear Incoherence: Deterrence Theory and Non-Strategic Nuclear Weapons in Russia (2014) The Journal of Strategic Studies, 37 (1), pp. 91-134; Aleshin, O.V., Popov, A.N., Puchnin, V.V., Voenno-morskaya moshch Rossii v sovremennykh geopoliticheskikh usloviyakh (2016) Voennaya mysl’, , July; Arbatov, A., Foreword (2010) Non-Strategic Nuclear Weapons: Problems of Control and Reduction, , Diakov A., Myasnikov E., Kadyshev, 3–4 T., (eds), Dolgoprudny: Institute of Physics and Technology; Arbatov, A., Takticheskoe yadernoe oruzhe–problemy i resheniya (2010) Voenno-promyshlennyi kurer, , May; Arbatov, A., Beyond the Nuclear Threshold: Russia, NATO, and Nuclear First Use (2017) ELN Issue Brief: Arms Control, , http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/medialibrary/2017/04/21/94c24315/Beyond%20the%20Nuclear%20Threshold.pdf; Arbatov, A., Understanding the US–Russia Nuclear Schism (2017) Survival, 59, pp. 33-66. , April–May; Belozerov, V., Lebedkova, E., Takticheskoe yadernoe oruzhie–kozyrnaya karta Rossii (2011) Nezavisimoe voennoe obozrenie, , June; Blank, S., (2011) Russian Nuclear Weapons: Past, Present, and Future, , Carslie: SSI; Dyner, A.M., Kavkaz 2016: The Next Test of Russia’s Armed Forces (2016) Bulletin PISM, , September; Isachenkov, V., (2017) Russia to Rely Increasingly on Non-Nuclear Deterrent, , Associated Press, February; Karaganov, S., Global Zero and Common Sense (2010) Russia in Global Affairs, , July; Kashin, V., Raska, M., (2017) Countering the US Third Offset Strategy: Russia Perspectives, Responses and Challenges, , Singapore: S.

By differentiating between physical and digital critical infrastructure protection, the article explores the promises and pitfalls of cyber deterrence in practice.

The Cold War, despite some dangerous episodes in U.S.-Soviet relations, was for the most part conducted under two important restraints. The first restraint was the strategic nuclear bipolarity that dominated the international system. The United States (plus NATO) and the Soviet Union dominated the development of military-strategic thinking related to the use of nuclear weapons for deterrence. They also led the way in developing and deploying nuclear technology for military purposes. As a result, the U.S. and the Soviet Union cast shadows over other powers, including other nuclear weapons states, that inhibited nuclear adventurism and irresponsible nuclear saber rattling. Other nuclear weapons states and nuclear aspiring countries knew that, if push came to shove, the United States and the Soviet Union had ""escalation dominance"" within their respective regions and spheres of influence. The Suez crisis of 1956 drove home this point, about nuclear-strategic bipolarity as a reality of the Cold War international system. © 2016 Stephen J. Cimbala.

The renewed crisis between the West (the United States and NATO member states) and Russia demonstrates how critical these elements are to the strategic nuclear relationship. As a result of recent setbacks between Washington and Moscow in the past few years, arms control has taken a back seat, and the risk of conflict due to miscalculation is the highest it has been since the 1980s. If the United States and Russia want to rebuild trust and continue reducing the risk of nuclear use, a meaningful dialogue is needed to reconcile nuclear deterrence and nuclear arms control. How can the world’s two largest nuclear superpowers re-establish the harmony that once existed between deterrence and arms control? What should a stable framework look like for managing that nuclear relationship, taking into account other regional security challenges? The answer to these questions lies in establishing a new, common interpretation of US–Russian strategic stability. Both parties need to find mutually acceptable solutions to the challenges of reconciling nuclear deterrence and arms control. In general, the most important issues include disputes surrounding strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, global ballistic missile defense capabilities, and the problems of conventional precision-guided munitions. © 2017 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.","arms control; missile defense; Nuclear deterrence; precision-guided munitions; strategic stability; US–Russia relations",,,,,,,,,"Adamsky, D., If War Comes Tomorrow: Russian Thinking About ‘Regional Nuclear Deterrence (2014) The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, 27 (1), pp. 163-188; Adamsky, D., Cross-Domain Coercion: The Current Russian at of Strategy (2015) IFRI Proliferation Papers 54, , http://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/pp54adamsky.pdf, Accessed, Nov; Anichkina, T., Esin, V., Strategic Nuclear Weapons of the Russian Federation.

Russia’s large-scale exercises incorporate the scenarios of a limited nuclear strike against NATO as part of Moscow’s “escalation to de-escalate” concept. Russia has acquired an edge over NATO in tactical nuclear weaponry and is expanding the range of tactical delivery systems. Moscow’s political rhetoric includes nuclear threats toward the West. NATO’s range of response options to such threats and limited nuclear war scenarios has shrunk considerably, and the alliance to lacks the collective will to call those threats a bluff. Because of Russia’s regional superiority in conventional forces and its anti-access/area denial capabilities, the Baltic area is particularly vulnerable. Despite deployment of Enhanced Forward Presence units to the eastern flank members, NATO still relies on deterrence by punishment to prevent the possibility of Russian military attack in the area. But Russia’s posture and capabilities could allow it to seize the Baltics, establishing a relatively quick fait accompli that it then defends by issuing nuclear threats. To prevent Russian miscalculation of the alliance’s determination–a miscalculation that could lead to a major war–NATO needs to build credible conventional deterrence in the Baltic area, making it impossible for Russia to seize any of these countries quickly. © 2017 Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.","Baltic states; Deterrence by denial; deterrence by punishment; Enhanced Forward Presence; limited war; NATO; Russia; tactical nuclear weapons",,,,,,,,,"Barnes, J.E., NATO Accuses Russia of Loose Talk on Nuclear Weapons (2016) The Wall Street Journal, , February; Russian Postures and Policies on Nuclear Deterrence, First Use, and the Nuclear Threshold: Balancing a Tightrope (2000) Special Intelligence Report, , https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005460644.pdf; Clark, W., Luik, J., Ramms, E., Shirreff, R., (2016) Closing NATO’s Baltic Gap, , Tallinn: International Centre for Defence and Security (ICDS); Corbett, J.S., (1911) Some Principles of Maritime Strategy, , http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15076/15076-h/15076-h.htm, London: Longmans, Green and Co; Durkalec, J., (2015) Nuclear-Backed “Little Green Men”: Nuclear Messaging in the Ukraine Crisis, , http://www.stratcomcoe.org/jdurkalec-nuclear-backed-little-green-men-nuclear-messaging-ukraine-crisis, Warsaw: Polish Institute of International Affairs; Flores, R., Newt Gingrich: NATO Countries ‘Ought to Worry’ about U.S. Commitment (2016) CBS News, , http://www.cbsnews.com/news/newt-gingrich-trump-would-reconsider-his-obligation-to-nato/, July; Freedman, L., (2004) Deterrence, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Galeotti, M., (2016) Heavy Metal Diplomacy: Russia’s Political Use of Its Military in Europe since 2014, , http://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/heavy_metal_diplomacy_russias_political_use_of_its_military_in_europe_since, London: European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR); Gordon, M.R., Russian Cruise Missile, Deployed Secretly, Violates Treaty, Officials Say (2017) The New York Times, , https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/europe/russia-cruise-missile-arms-control-treaty.html, February; Gray, C.S., (1999) Modern Strategy, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Jermalavičius, T., NATO’s Ballistic Missile Defence System and Dialogue with Russia: From ‘Talking past Each Other’ to Facing down a Bully?

Today, only four nuclear submarines ""Le Triomphant"", equipped with 16 ballistic missiles M-45 or M-51 that can be launched suddenly from the distance 6000-9000 meters provide nuclear deterrence and protect France's independency. The second component of French nuclear forces are ""Rafale"" fighters: until 2023, France should have received 294 ""Rafales"", including 60 as nuclear weapons carriers with ASMP-A missile. French nuclear strategy is reflected in two ""White Books on the Defense"", published in 2008 and in 2013. According to it, the key change in the world is a deficit of stability: the world did not grow more stable, strategic uncertainty allows France to become a potential target for foreign missiles. Main threats for French interests are concentrated in an axis: Atlantic Ocean - Mediterranean Sea - Indian Ocean, the heart of communications between America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Five components of French nuclear strategy are forecasting, threat prevention, deterrence, defense of borders and intervention. Forecasting is considered to be a priority, but just in case nuclear forces could be used abroad in independent French operations and collective operations. French nuclear forces contribute in common defense concepts of the EU and NATO but their potential use is conditioned by a French president's decisions in every case. After the end of the Cold War Russia was considered in Paris much more as a ""disturbing neighbor"" than as a ""potential enemy"". While French experts had recommended to ""hold and constantly enforce"" relations with Russia, the Ukrainian crisis of 2014-2015 proved these wishes were not implemented. But even now it is hard to imagine France using its nuclear arsenal to press Moscow. After the end of the Cold War France reduced its nuclear arsenal. During 1992-2016, the number of nuclear warhead was reduced from 540 to 300. Paris pulled in financing of nuclear field, and after 1996 interrupted nuclear tests. At the same time, France cannot be considered as a strong follower of nuclear disarmament: Paris opposes not nuclear race, but enlargement of the ""nuclear club"".","AMB; Deterrence; Disarmament; EU; France; NATO; Nuclear weapons; Russian-French relations",,,,,,,,,"Mikhailov, V.N., (2008) Yadernoe Oruzhie i Natsional'naya Bezopasnost'.

There is now a new urgency to look at North Korean nuclear weapon program with serious attention. The DPRK has signaled it may be ready to resume negotiation. It is clear that engagement of the DPRK is essential to resolve this stalemate and such engagement cannot be limited to just nuclear and missile issues but should extend to a more comprehensive agenda. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach towards establishing Northeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, in which three countries (the DPRK, the ROK and Japan) declare non-nuclear weapon status and the other three nuclear weapon states (the United States, Russia and China) provide negative security assurances under thelegally binding treaty. Hie comprehensive approach also includes agreement on; 1) termination of Korean War, 2) equal access to all forms of energy 3) establishment of a permanent Northeast Asia Security Council. It is essential for non-governmental actors to initiate regional confidence-building process on Track 2 level. The authors hope such process, called the ""Nagasaki Process"" will become a new platform for security dialogue among interested parties in the region, eventually leading to peace and security of Northeast Asia, contributing to global efforts to achieve a world without nuclear weapons. © 2016 by Institute Of Korean Studies.","Confidence building; Nagasaki process; North Korea; Northeast Asia; Nuclear weapon; Nuclear weapon free zone",,,,,,,,,"Asmolov, K., Nuclear weapons in South Korea under discussion (2016) New Eastern Outlook, , http://journal-neo.org/2016/11/10/nuclear-weapons-in-south-korea-under-discussion/, October 11; Carlin, R., North Korea said if s willing to talk denuclearization (But No One Noticed) (2016) The Diplomat, , http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/north-korea-said-its-willing-To-Talk-denuclearization-but-no-one-noticed, July 13; Halperin, M.H., A Proposal for a nuclear weapons-free zone in Northeast Asia (2011) Global Asia, 6 (4). , (Winter) Originally presented at 'East Asia Nuclear Security Workshop, ' November 11, 2011, Tokyo, cosponsored by Nautilus Institute, Mansfield Foundation, and Asia-Pacific Leadership Network for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament(APLN); Lewis, J., Security challenges and denuclearization of Northeast Asia (2016) Lecture Given at the Public Symposium, How to Respond to Nuclear Threats?

Having analyzed well-known cases of the U.S. and Soviet (Russian) BMEWS false alarms, the author comes to a conclusion that the role of a ""human factor"" in preventing fatal mistakes in decision-making process is most important. At the same time, the very existence of an early warning system has rather negative than positive effect on strategic stability. The author states that without BMEWS, the strategic situation could be probably less predictable, but more stable since in that case it excluded launch-on-warning options for military-political leadership of the two great nuclear powers. The early warning system could be used by a ""third power"" to provoke a nuclear conflict between Russia and the United States; it can be vulnerable to a cyber-attack, or just initiate a false alarm due to a technical error as it took place before. All this can result in a fatal decision to launch nuclear weapons on warning of such an ""attack"". The present procedure which includes a ""nuclear case"" with a ""red button"" in it not only provides, but also contributes to such an option. The author concludes that the present unstable situation with BMEWS can be improved only by adding ballistic missile defense to the state security system of Russia. It is suggested that Russian authorities reconsider their negative attitude towards ballistic missile defense and start a national-wide program to provide a ""thin"" defense for the most populated territories of the state. This move could contribute to security by offering the leadership other options in case the BMEWS initiates an alarming signal.

It bears on fundamental questions, such as: How should the US manage its alliances? Should it establish a multilateral nuclear policy dialogue in Asia? In what depth should it discuss issues of doctrine and targeting with its Asian allies? What capabilities might reassure European allies in light of current Russian revisionism? Could nuclear war be limited and controlled in an East Asian maritime arena? Do nuclear weapons strengthen an alliance, or do they introduce a divisive bone of contention? Is extended nuclear deterrence (END) stabilizing or is it on the contrary pushing the allies to ask for more? What is the relationship between nuclear and conventional forces in END credibility? How do nuclear alliances contribute to international security and international order? The lessons and insights from these papers, which look at five historical cases of US extended deterrence during the Cold War, should help us think about crucial current issues, and be of use both to historians who want to have a better understanding of the Cold War past and to policymakers who are currently grappling with these issues. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; extended deterrence; Germany; Italy; Japan; Nuclear weapons; South Korea; US alliances","Cold War; international relations; nuclear weapon; policy making; regional security; Australia; Germany; Italy; Japan; South Korea; United States",,,,,,,,"Bracken, P.J., (2012) The Second Nuclear Age.

Limited-presence arrangements are likely to fall short of their deterrent purpose if they fail to account for Russia’s growing ability to threaten NATO’s operational access to the Baltics. Martin Zapfe and Michael Carl Haas argue that any NATO strategy of assured access would face significant hurdles and come at a price. Although it could considerably strengthen conventional deterrence, such a strategy would be liable to exacerbate the regional security dilemma and could lead to a lasting regionalisation of the Alliance. © RUSI JOURNAL.",,,,,,,,,,"Glatz, R.L., Zapfe, M., NATO Defence Planning between Wales and Warsaw: Politico-Military Challenges of a Credible Assurance against Russia (2016) SWP Comments, (5), 2p. , January; Lasconjarias, G., Marrone, A., How to Respond to Anti- Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)?

In particular, this book seeks to interrogate the theory and strategy of nuclear deterrence, and its relationship to the concept of missile defence. Drawing widely on the theoretical literature in international relations and strategic studies, it identifies the key groups that have competed over America's nuclear policy post-1945 and examines how the concept of missile defence went through a process of gestation and intellectual contestation, leading to its eventual legitimization in the late 1990s. Steff sheds light on the individuals, groups, institutions and processes that led to the decision by the Bush administration to deploy a national missile defence shield. Additionally, Steff systematically examines the impact deployment had on the calculations of Russia and China. In the process he explains that their reactions under the Bush administration have continued into the Obama era, revealing that a new great power security dilemma has broken out. This, Steff shows, has led to a decline in great power relations as a consequence. © 2013 Reuben Steff.

The article suggests an explanation why ends, means and ways of 'regional deterrence' are not always calibrated among different parts of the Russian strategic community. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Participation in international military operations was not the driving factor. The expense of NATO membership was merely a means to that end, seen as an investment in a security deposit one could draw upon in harder times. Few today envisage a US or NATO nuclear retaliation as a response to Russia’s interference in e.g. a Baltic country, as mentioned by Christopher Coker in Chap. and discussed in some more depth by Julian Lindley-French in Chap.

This form of military statecraft has made other former Soviet republics, such as the Baltic countries, fear that Russia would use subversion rather than pursue a conventional military engagement against them. Despite this concern about Russian hybrid war, existing descriptions of this form of war suffer from conceptual weaknesses. In this article hybrid warfare is conceived as a strategy that marries conventional deterrence and insurgency tactics. That is, the belligerent uses insurgent tactics against its target while using its conventional military power to deter a strong military response. The article then outlines why some former Soviet republics are susceptible to Russian hybrid warfare, allowing it to postulate inductively the conditions under which hybrid warfare might be used in general. The analysis yields two policy implications. First, military solutions are not wholly appropriate against hybrid warfare since it exploits latent ethnic grievances and weak civil societies. Second, only under narrow circumstances would belligerents resort to hybrid warfare. Belligerents need to be revisionist and militarily stronger than their targets, but they also need to have ethnic or linguistic ties with the target society to leverage in waging hybrid warfare. © 2016 The Royal Institute of International Affairs.",,,,,,,,,,"Czuperski, M., Herbst, J., Higgins, E., Polyajova, E., Wilson, D., Hiding in plain sight: Putin's war in Ukraine (Washington DC: Atlantic Council, 2015), (2015), http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/publications/reports/hiding-in-plain-sight-putin-s-war-in-ukraine-and-boris-nemtsov-s-putin-war, accessed 13 Nov; Mark, Galeotti, The ""Gerasimov Doctrine"" and Russian non-linear war https://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2014/07/06/the-gerasimov-doctrine-and-russian-nonlinear-war, Moscow's Shadows, 6 July 2014, accessed 13 Nov. 2015; How Russia sees Baltic sovereignty http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/how-russia-sees-baltic-sovereignty/525643.html, Moscow Times, 14 July 2015, accessed 13 Nov. 2015; How Russia sees Baltic sovereignty (2015), http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/how-russia-sees-baltic-sovereignty/525643.html, Moscow Times, 14 July 2015,accessed 13 Nov; Jervis, R., The meaning of the nuclear revolution (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press) (1989); Glenn, R.W., Thoughts on ""hybrid"" conflict', Small Wars Journal, 2 March (2009), http://smallwarsjournal.com/mag/docs-temp/188-glenn.pdf, accessed 13 Nov. 2015; Murray, W., Mansoor, P.R., Hybrid warfare: fighting complex opponents from the ancient world to the present (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) (2012), p. 3; Wilson, A., Ukraine crisis: what it means for the West (New Haven: Yale University Press) (2014), p. 129; Campbell, B.B., The SA after the Rohm purge (1993) Journal of Contemporary History, 28 (4), p. 667; Valentino, B., Huth, P., Balch-Lindsay, D., ""Draining the sea"": mass killing and guerrilla warfare (2004) International Organization, 58 (2), pp. 383-384; Fazal, T., State death: the politics and geography of conquest, occupation, and annexation (2007), (Princeton: Princeton University Press); Hurd, I., After anarchy: legitimacy and power in the United Nations Security Council (Princeton: Princeton University Press) (2007); Thompson, A., Coercion through IOs: the Security Council and the logic of information transmission (2006) International Organization, 60 (1), pp. 1-34; Smith, A., The ethnic origins of nations (Oxford: Blackwell) (1986), pp. 22-28; Haas, E.B., What is nationalism and why should we study it?

The author pays attention to the strategic triad confi guration which makes nuclear deterrence more effective and reliable. Along with it the credibility of nuclear deterrence is also under consideration as a very important element of the overall problem analysis. The central part of the article is devoted to the problem of nuclear targeting and possible application of nuclear weapons in case the deterrence failed, and the decision to use these weapons were taken. The author argues that there is no rational variant to apply nuclear weapons without unpredictable and deadly reaction from the opposite side. There is no hope to achieve any positive result after the fi rst use of nuclear weapons - whether strategic or tactical. Thus, a massive counterforce strike cannot prevent from a massive retaliation resulting in the complete annihilation of the rivalries. A limited strike against strategic offensive forces of the opponent can be interpreted as a massive strike ending with massive retaliation. A single strike cannot solve any military problem and, moreover, may give strategic initiative to the opponent. Tactical nuclear forces can be used in different, but generally ""unproductive"" ways - whether against the own territory, or by solving only limited tasks, while producing an unpredictable reaction from the opponent. The author comes to a conclusion that the nuclear weapon is only an instrument of self-destruction which cannot solve any security problem. It can only play a symbolic role in terms of the country's prestige, and nothing else. Finally, the author insists that the strategic stability concept started to play a counter-productive role in the U.S.-Russia strategic relations, and must be substituted by a new approach to security. This approach should reject the central idea of strategic stability which calls for preserving a powerful retaliatory potential.

This article examines the goal of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report to rely less on nuclear weapons while increasing the role of conventional weapons to meet US security needs. It also addresses the effect that this change could have on both Russia and China. Because deterrence is a psychological function in the mind of the adversary, it is imperative to take into account his unique aspects and tailor deterrence strategies accordingly. This article argues that instead of increasing stability with Russia and China, the United States' desire to rely more on conventional weapons has caused those countries to feel less secure and rely more on nuclear weapons, potentially creating dangerous instability in deterrent relationships. © 2015 US Air Force Air University.

Utopians tend to see a predictable international system based on widely accepted cooperative norms and the rule of law as a feasible alternative to nuclear weapons and deterrence. Such a cooperative system would either preclude or minimize conflict in the international system and thereby enable the global elimination of nuclear weapons. US policies, they often say, should help promote the establishment of cooperative international norms against nuclear arms via continuing US movement away from nuclear weapons. Realists do not accept the possibility of nuclear disarmament in the absence of a fundamental change in the international order, concluding that, despite the obvious potential advantages of a cooperative international order and the rule of law, there is little or no evidence, past or present, to suggest that international cooperative norms and legal structures can or will supersede raison d’État as the basis for state behavior. Contemporary Russian military action in Central Europe confirms this conclusion. Consequently, realists tend to reject utopian recommendations regarding US nuclear deterrence policies and forces, instead favoring the sustainment of US nuclear capabilities for the deterrence of foes and the assurance of allies. © 2015 US Air Force Air University.

This article deals with the first two of these aspects only: the interaction between missile defenses and offensive force reductions in US-Russian strategy and policy. The findings are that stable deterrence as between the USA and Russia is possible at lower than New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty levels, but reductions below 1000 deployed long-range weapons for each state, toward a true minimum deterrent posture, will require multilateral as opposed to bilateral coordination of arms limitations. Missile defenses might provide some denial capability against light attacks by states with small arsenals, but they still fall short of meaningful damage limitation as between powers capable of massive nuclear strikes. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","arms control; assured retaliation; BMD; deterrence; EPAA (European Phased Adaptive Approach for missile defense); minimum deterrence; missile defenses; NATO; New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) agreement; non-strategic nuclear weapons; nuclear weapons",,,,,,,,,"Butler, D., Flaws found in US missile shield for Europe (2013) Army Times, , http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2013/02/ap-flaws-missile-shield- 020913, Associated Press, , February 9, accessed February 11 2013; US missile defense shield flawed - Classified studies (2013) Russia Today (RT), , http://rt.com/usa/news/us-missile-defense-flaws-811/print/, February 11, accessed February 11 2013; Lewis, G.N., Postol, T.A., The astonishing national academy of sciences missile defense report (2013) Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, , http://www.thebulletin.org/print/web-edition/op-eds/the-astonishing- national-academy-of-sciences-missile-defense-report.html, September 20, accessed February 11 2013; Morton, J.F., Galdorisi, G., Any sensor: Any shooter: Toward an Aegis BMD global enterprise (2012) Joint Force Quarterly, 67, pp. 85-90. , 4th Quarter; Frank, A., (2012) Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, Growing Global Cooperation on Ballistic Missile Defense, , http://www.state.gov/t/avc/rls/197547.htm, Rose Deputy Assistant Secretary, , Remarks as Prepared, Berlin, Germany, September 10, accessed September 13 2012; Kipp, Russia?s Nuclear Posture and the Threat That Dare Not Speak Its Name, pp. 459-503. , Chap. 10 in Russian Nuclear Weapons: Past, Present and Future, ed.

The article argues that during the last two decades doctrinal postulates related to regional deterrence have not always been supported by actual assets, several capabilities have been existing in a conceptual vacuum, and several nuclear industry initiatives have been disconnected from official policy. The article suggests an explanation why ends, means and ways of 'regional deterrence' are not always calibrated among different parts of the Russian strategic community.

But-whether the context is major powers seeking to neutralise threats from each other (United States, Russia, China and India), non-nuclear allies seeking nuclear protection from various threat contingencies (Japan, South Korea and Australia) or vulnerable states seeking a 'strategic equaliser' (Pakistan and North Korea)-the traditional strategic arguments for nuclear deterrence are much weaker than they may first seem. Whatever may have been the case for the Cold War years, in today's world the risks associated with the acquisition or retention of nuclear weapons far outweigh any conceivable utility they may have. The financial arguments against them-that they are indefensibly costly-are strong. And the humanitarian arguments are overwhelming: nuclear weapons remain the most indiscriminately inhumane ever devised, and they should be outlawed as chemical and biological weapons have been. Making disarmament happen will never be easy, but-with the right political leadership-is not impossible. Focusing, realistically, in the first instance on minimization rather than elimination, practical steps can be taken to dramatically reduce nuclear weapon numbers, deployment and alert status, and doctrinal reliance on them. Doing so would dramatically reduce, both regionally and globally, the now ever-present risk of nuclear catastrophe. © 2014 Asia and the Pacific Policy Studies published by Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd and Crawford School of Public Policy at The Australian National University.","Asia; Deterrence; Disarmament; Nuclear; Pacific",,,,,,,,,,"Evans, G.; Australian National UniversityAustralia; email: ge@gevans.org",,,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",,,,,20502680,,,,"English","Asia Pacafic Policy.

Strategic nonnuclear deterrence with the use of high-precision long-range weapons, which is considered as complementary to, rather than substituting for, strategic nuclear weapons, plays an increasingly important role. The effective strategic nonnuclear deterrence depends, to even a larger extent than nuclear deterrence, on the capacity of relevant information and communication infrastructure. It is argued that one should pay special attention to such infrastructure, which should be developed proactively with regard to striking weapons. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,"Putin, V.V., (2013) Rossiiskaya Gazeta, , http://www.putin2012.ru/#article-6; Arbatov, A.G., Dvorkin, V.Z., Pikaev, A.A., Oznobishchev, S.K., (2010) Strategic Stability after the Cold War, , www.imemo.ru/ru/publ/2010/10026.pdf, Moscow: IMEMO RAN; Kokoshin, A.A., (2010) Problems of Ensuring Strategic Stability: Theoretical and Applied Issues, , 2nd ed.th edn., Moscow: KRASAND; (2010) Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, , http://news.kremlin.ru, Cited October 15, 2013; Zhuravlev, A.L., Nestik, T.A., Soenin, V.A., (2013) Psychological Aspects of Strategic Stability and Nuclear Deterrence, , http://www.ipas.ru/engine/documents; Shultz, G.P., Perry, W.J., Kissinger, H.A., Nunn, S., World free of nuclear weapons (2007) Wall Street Journal, , http://online.wsj.com/news/arti-cles/sb1678751525166636; Rifkind, M., Owen, D., Hurd, D., Robertson, G., Start worrying and learn to ditch the bomb (2008) The Times, , http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/commtnt/guest-contributors/article4237387.ece; Primakov, E., Ivanov, I., Velikhov, E., Moiseev, M., From Nuclear deterrence to general security (2010) Izvestiya; Kokoshin, A.A., (2006) Real Sovereignty in the Contemporary World Political System, , 3rd ed.th edn., Moscow: Evropa; Trubnikov, V.I., Nuclear status' in the foreign and domestic policy of India and Pakistan: A view from Russia (2012) Prospects for India and Pakistan to Join Nuclear Arms Limitation, , A.

This study disentangles Russian thoughts and deeds about regional nuclear deterrence and the role of NSNW in it. Situating the Russian case in the comparative context, the article argues that establishing a coherent theater nuclear posture and streamlining it with the national level deterrence strategy is a demanding and frequently unfulfilled task.

In particular, this book seeks to interrogate the theory and strategy of nuclear deterrence, and its relationship to the concept of missile defence. Drawing widely on the theoretical literature in international relations and strategic studies, it identifies the key groups that have competed over America's nuclear policy post-1945 and examines how the concept of missile defence went through a process of gestation and intellectual contestation, leading to its eventual legitimization in the late 1990s. Steff sheds light on the individuals, groups, institutions and processes that led to the decision by the Bush administration to deploy a national missile defence shield. Additionally, Steff systematically examines the impact deployment had on the calculations of Russia and China. In the process he explains that their reactions under the Bush administration have continued into the Obama era, revealing that a new great power security dilemma has broken out. This, Steff shows, has led to a decline in great power relations as a consequence. © Reuben Steff 2013.

The first was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a constellation of space- and ground-based systems that President Ronald Reagan envisioned would render nuclear weapons ""impotent and obsolete."" The second is President Barack Obama's roadmap to ""a world without nuclear weapons,"" commonly referred to as ""Global Zero."" While these proposals appear to have little in common, deeper investigation reveals a number of provocative similarities in motivation and presentation. Moreover, both generated fierce debate, often with ideological overtones, about their strategic desirability and technical feasibility. We use these parallels, as well as prominent dissimilarities, to draw lessons from the SDI experience that can be applied to the debate over Global Zero. © 2013 Copyright Monterey Institute of International Studies, James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.","Ballistic missile defense; China; Global Zero; nuclear deterrence; nuclear disarmament; nuclear weapons; Russia; Soviet Union; Strategic Defense Initiative; United States",,,,,,,,,"Reagan, R., (1983) Address to The Nation On Defense and National Security, , www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1983/32383d.htm, March 23; Lettow, P., (2005) Ronald Reagan and His Quest to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, , New York: Random House; Rhodes, R., (2007) Arsenals of Folly: The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race, pp. 176-177. , New York: Alfred E.

U.S. and Russian negotiators will have to overcome both political and military obstacles to accomplish post-New START reductions in long-range nuclear weapons. For example, efforts to reduce offensive nuclear weapons are complicated by U.S. and NATO plans for missile defenses deployed in Europe and by exigencies in U.S. and Russian domestic politics. In addition, the military-technical aspects of cyber war and nuclear deterrence can no longer be treated, analytically or practically, as isolated compartments. This article considers several aspects of the relationships among possible post-START offensive force reductions, advanced conventional weapons including missile defenses, and emerging cyber capabilities. © 2013.",,,,,,,,,,"(2013), http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/transcript-president-barack-obamas-2013-state-union.html, Transcript of President Barack Obama's 2013 State of the Union Address, ABC News, Feb. 12; Blitz, J., Russia and the U.S.: Obama Tries Again on Nuclear Weapons (2013) Financial Times, , Feb. 13, Johnson's Russia List 2013 - #30, Feb. 13; Sanger, D.E., Obama to Renew Drive for Cuts in Nuclear Arms (2013) New York Times, , http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/obama-to-renew-drive-for-cuts-in-nuclear-arms.html, Feb. 10; Butler, D., (2013), http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2013/02/ap-flaws-missile-shield-020913, Associated Press, ""Flaws found in U.S. Missile Shield for Europe,"" Army Times, Feb. 9; (2013), http://rt.com/usa/news/us-missile-defense-flaws-811/print/, U.S. Missile Defense Shield Flawed-Classified Studies,"" Russia Today, Feb. 11; (2012), www.nap.edu, Committee on an Assessment of Concepts and Systems for U.S. Boost-Phase Missile Defense in Comparison to Other Alternatives, Making Sense of Ballistic Missile Defense: An Assessment of Concepts and Systems for U.S. Boost-Phase Missile Defense in Comparison to Other Alternatives (Washington, D.C.: National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, National Academies Press; Lewis, G.L., Postol, T.A., The Astonishing National Academy of Sciences Missile Defense Report (2013) Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, , http://www.thebulletin.org/print/web-edition/op-eds/the-astonishing-national-academy-of-sciences-missile-defense-report.html, Sept. 20; (2012), http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/opinion/31iht-edalbright31.html, Madeleine Albright and Igor Ivanov, ""A New Agenda for U.S.-Russia Cooperation,"" New York Times, Dec. 31; Ryabkov, S., (2012), Interview, Ekho Moskvy Radio, Nov. 8, 2012, BBC Monitoring, in Johnson's Russia List 2012 - #198, Nov. 9; Sanger, Obama to Renew Drive for Cuts in Nuclear Arms ; For U.S. and NATO missile defense plans; O'Reilly, J., http://www.mda.mil/news/downloadable_resources.html, USA, Director, Missile Defense Agency, Ballistic Missile Defense Overview, Presented to 10th Annual Missile Defense Conference (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Defense, March 26, 2012, 12-MDA-6631); (2010), http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/140035.pdf, Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of State, April 8; The Obama Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense will retain and improve some technologies deployed by the George W.

But the second Obama administration encounters increasing difficulties to reconcile the logic of the Global Zero with the preservation of American nuclear primacy. On the one hand, the United States seeks to establish some sort of strategic stability with Russia and China through the recognition of mutual vulnerabilities. But on the other hand, Washington believes that the conditions of stability can no longer, if ever, be confined to the nuclear field. Two factors seem to indicate the limits of this concept, and play an increasing role in the American debate on deterrence. These two factors are firstly the developments in Asia, particularly the prospects for Sino-US relations, and secondly the uncertainties about the militarization of cyberspace.",,,,,,,,,,"Acton, J.M., Bombs away?

Pacing technology is being exploited by an increasingly mature missile defense. If implemented comprehensively, it could have widespread and revolutionary ramifications. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The article describes the historical background of America's nuclear strategy, from Eisenhower to the Obama Administration. It then traces the history of missile defense and arms limitation and develops the context of the interaction between them. It is found that nuclear arsenals should not be reduced to zero because that would put rogue nations in a position where they could intimidate the world. Finally, the evolution of computer chip technology, as embodied by Moore's law, is traced. The recommendation is made to proceed with the reduction of nuclear stockpiles to the level of a few hundred each, and to proceed with the implementation of comprehensive missile defenses. Findings: The most important is the practicality of reducing nuclear arsenals to a few hundred on either side. That strategy is called ""moral deterrence"" herein. It is moral because, as opposed to MAD, it does not hold extensive civilian populations of the world hostage. At the same time, it is a sufficiently strong deterrent to prevent rogue nations from acquiring and threatening with illicit nuclear weapons. Moral deterrence is a better strategic option than the ""nuclear-free world"" advocated by the Obama administration since nuclear-free does not preclude intimidation by rogues. Research limitations/implications: Technology enabling reliable missile defense is based on high-speed, large-capacity, miniaturized computer chips. It permits fast and reliable computations that can process real-time data from radar, infrared, and optical sensors so that a hit-to-kill capability can be realized. It also permits the implementation of deformable mirrors for the adaptive optics used in high-energy lasers. Much of the technology for modern missile defense flowed from the Strategic Defense Initiative; it was not predicted by the critics of three decades ago. Originality/value: The principal aspects of originality involve the analytical tradeoffs between the nuclear stockpiles of the principal powers and the viability of missile defense. The analysis indicates that if the stockpiles are reduced to a few hundred each, then even imperfect missile defense is very effective in providing protection, providing it is triply redundant. Stockpiles reduced to ten or less leave the principal powers vulnerable to intimidation by rogue nations, and should be avoided. The article also finds that missile defense has been enabled technologically by Moore's law, and that it can be expected to improve further by the year 2020. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","International conflict; Nuclear weapons; Strategy; Technology-led strategy; Terrorism; Warfare",,,,,,,,,"(2011) Expanded umbrella, , June 27, Aviation Week and Space Technology; Bergman, J., (2009) Meeting the Demands of Reason - The Life and Thought of Andrei Sakharov, , Cornell University Press, New York, NY; (2009) Israel, US to embark on collaborating 'upper-tier' missile intercept program to include Arrow 3 and land-based SM-3 missile, , http://defense-update.com/products/a/arrow3.html, available at, Holdings Defense Update Online; Fulghum, D., Ben-David, A., Israel expands missile defence shield to counter improved threats (2010) Aviation Week and Space Technology, pp. 58-60. , October 4; Keeton, A., Laser warfare is moving closer to reality (2010) Wall Street Journal, pp. B7. , February 24; Mollick, E., Establishing Moore's law (2006) IEEE Anals, 28 (3), pp. 62-75. , July-September","Schaffer, M.; Rand Corporation, Santa Monica, CA, United States; email: marv@rand.org",,,,,,,,14636689,,,,"English","Foresight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861813732

It argues that the pattern of presidential discourse reveals that both presidents have regarded Russia's nuclear weapons as primarily political rather than military instruments. Both Putin and Medvedev demonstrated a sustained desire to pursue strategic nuclear arms reductions through negotiations, particularly on a bilateral basis with the United States, and an interest in minimum nuclear deterrence. The shifts in position taken by both presidents on US plans for missile defence in particular reveal that they each attached as much, if not more, importance to Russia being regarded as an equal partner by the United States than to any strategic gains that might be achieved through preventing the deployment of an effective missile defence system. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"foreign policy; international relations; leadership; nuclear weapon; Russian Federation",,,,,,,,"Dinerstein, H.S., (1962) War and the Soviet Union: Nuclear Weapons and the Revolution in Soviet Military and Political Thinking, , New York: Frederick A.

In 2007, near the end of then-President Vladimir Putin's second term in office, he appointed Anatoliy Serdyukov-the former head of the Federal Tax Service-as defense minister as part of an effort to combat corruption in the military and carry out reforms. After the August 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict revealed large-scale Russian military operational failures, the leadership became more determined to boost military capabilities. U.S. government and congressional policymakers are following the progress and goals of these reforms as they consider issues related to U.S.-Russia relations and U.S. national security interests. The reforms launched by Russian leadership called for reducing the total size of the armed forces from its size of 1.2 million in 2008 to under 1 million. Three major initiatives included accelerating planned cuts in the officer corps to reduce their numbers from 355,000 to a later-adjusted total of 220,000. The reforms also included revamping the training of noncommissioned officers to make them more effective and introducing military police, both aimed partly at boosting discipline in the barracks. The reforms aimed to reduce the four-tier command system of military districts, armies, divisions, and regiments to a two-tier system of strategic commands and fully manned brigades that could be quickly deployed for combat. A large-scale 10-year weapons modernization plan also was launched, and military budgets are being increased substantially. The weapons modernization plan prioritizes the procurement of new missiles and platforms to maintain strategic nuclear deterrence, but also includes new planes, helicopters, ships, missiles, and submarines for the Ground Forces, Air Force, Navy, and other arms of service. Russia's national security strategy, military doctrine, and some aspects of the military reforms reflect assessments by some Russian policymakers that the United States and NATO remain concerns, if not threats, to Russia's security. Other assessments, however, emphasize enhancing counter-terrorism capabilities and possibly hedges against the rise of China. Seeming to stress these latter concerns, in December 2008, Serdyukov asserted that the reforms were aimed at switching to a performance-capable, mobile, and maximally armed military ready to participate in at least three regional and local conflicts. Compared to Russia's previous attempts to revamp its armed forces, the current reform effort has gone further in altering the force structure and operations of the armed forces, according to most observers. However, the reforms face daunting delays, modifications, and setbacks. It remains highly uncertain whether Russia will be able to marshal the budgetary and demographic resources to field a substantially professional military with high readiness, as planned, or to modernize its ailing defense industries to obtain a new array of weaponry over the next 10 years. U.S. policymakers have maintained that Serdyukov's defense reforms pose both risks and opportunities for the United States and the West. While warning that Russian military programs are driven largely by Moscow's perception that the United States and NATO remain the greatest potential threats, U.S. policymakers also have raised the possibility that Russia's military reforms might in the future make it feel less strategically vulnerable and that it might participate more in international peacekeeping operations. In general, U.S. policymakers and others have urged a policy of hedging against these possible risks through countervailing diplomacy and defense efforts while also following an engagement policy with Russia to cooperate on global issues of mutual interest and to encourage Russia to democratize, respect human rights, and embrace pro-Western foreign policies. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

One of the most contentious issues between the United States and Russia in 2011-2012 was the Obama administration’s revised version of the US-NATO European-based missile defense plan. Russian political leaders criticized this plan, insisted on a shared Russian-NATO missile defense arrangement going forward, and threatened responsive countermeasures if the United States and NATO proceeded despite Russia’s objections.1 A NATO-Russia summit originally scheduled for May 2012 in Chicago was shelved in favor of other forums for consultations between President Obama and the newly reelected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Regardless of the outcome of dialogue with Russia, NATO planned to announce at its 2012 summit the onset of the first phase of its evolving European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) to European missile defense. © Adam B.

Because they are socially meaningful and organized patterns of action, practices have structuring effects on politics. At the regional level of analysis, security practices such as war, deterrence, diplomacy, arms control, and military exchanges generate configured fields of interaction with variable degrees of order. Security communities, for example, are constituted by the self-evident practice of diplomacy. Likewise, regional nuclear deterrence is made possible by a limited set of patterned gestures – weapons deployment, summit diplomacy, rhetorical formulas, disarmament talks, and so forth – that organize the security game in mutually intelligible terms. As the case of post-Cold War Russian–Atlantic relations makes clear, however, regional security practices do not always form coherent and well-ordered wholes. Quite often, regional configurations are comprised of competing ways of doing things. This practice clash may lead to unstable security dynamics in which the meanings of interaction are contested or at least not mutually recognized. The case of NATO–Russia politics is particularly evocative here. In the early 1990s both former enemies appeared to be seeking to transform regional security practices from Cold War realpolitik to a new game of cooperative security and democratic peace. But the practices that each side enacted to that end were generally encountered by the other as a continuation of the past instead of a call for change. NATO’s enlargement, to take the most prominent example, was linked back to containment practices in Moscow. Reciprocally, Russia’s reactions to expansion, particularly during the negotiations of the 1997 Founding Act with the Alliance, were construed as outdated superpower diplomacy in Brussels. As a result, respective security practices partly failed to constitute a new pattern of regional order. Although some change occurred, as evidenced by new practices of seminar diplomacy or joint military exercises, twenty years after the end of the Cold War Russian–Atlantic relations remain structured by a combination of competing practices that do not always sit easily with each other. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,,,,,,"Adler, E., Pouliot, V., International practices: Introduction and framework (2011) International Practices, , ed.

This chapter analyzes these challenges with an eye toward assessing the potential role of India, Israel, and Pakistan in the recently reinvigorated global eff ort to achieve universal nuclear disarmament. Its main argument is that the near- And medium- Term prospects for engaging these three countries in truly meaningful disarmament negotiations are exceedingly poor. The logic of grouping India, Israel, and Pakistan together is threefold. First, their development and continuing refi nement of nuclear- weapon capabilities is tightly bound to several of the world's most enduring and intractable politicalmilitary confl icts: The Arab- Israeli standoff , the regional rivalry between Iran and Israel, the Kashmir dispute dividing India and Pakistan, and the Sino- Indian geopolitical competition. These confl icts have been at the root of numerous wars, both conventional and unconventional, and each has proved stubbornly resistant to resolution. Consequently, strategic elites in India, Israel, and Pakistan continue to perceive a compelling need for ""immediate"" nuclear deterrence, whereas their counterparts in Britain, France, Russia, the United States, and to some degree China tend to be motivated by the more relaxed imperatives of ""general"" nuclear deterrence.2 Two decades aft er the Cold War's end, the persistence of regional cold wars in Asia and the Middle East is one of the greatest obstacles to the realization of universal nuclear disarmament. Second, compared to most of the more established nws, India, Israel, and Pakistan are still very much on the ascent in terms of the redundancy, diversity, and sophistication of their nuclear forces. Britain, France, Russia, and the United States have substantially reduced their nuclear- weapon capabilities in response to diminishing interstate security threats since the end of the Cold War. In contrast, the nuclear holdouts are considerably more potent nws than they were twenty years ago, and this upward trend continues. Since India and Pakistan went overtly nuclear with a series of explosive tests in May 1998, both countries have endeavored to increase the number of their nuclear weapons and improve their aircraft - And missile- delivery systems. India is avidly pursuing a full- blown, albeit modest, nuclear triad, and indications are that Pakistan will attempt to keep pace. Israel's nuclear- weapon capabilities are more robust than both India's and Pakistan's, and Israel has deployed its own nuclear triad since 2003. Moreover, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials (ipfm), ""only India, Pakistan and perhaps Israel and North Korea are producing additional fi ssile material for weapons.""3 In sum, judging by the best available open- source evidence, the nuclear holdouts' strategic momentum is moving away from, rather than toward, disarmament, with all three nuclear establishments working hard to achieve ever- more survivable second- strike arsenals. A third reason to consider India, Israel, and Pakistan in the same chapter is their history as opaque proliferants. Opacity in the nuclear context refers to a government's clandestine development of nuclear- weapon capabilities combined with its public disavowal of any intention to deploy nuclear weapons. The concept was developed in the 1980s to distinguish the nuclear holdouts from the fi ve countries recognized as nws by the npt, Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States, as well as to help analysts understand the political and strategic implications of this new form of proliferation.4 Israel was the prototype opaque proliferant and remains one today. India and Pakistan abandoned the Israeli model in 1998, but because they covertly went nuclear, in defi ance of the nonproliferation regime, they remain resistant to transparency in the nuclear realm. None of the three countries discloses details about the number of nuclear weapons it possesses, or how they are deployed, and all three governments believe that their deterrent postures are strengthened, rather than weakened, by preserving some measure of ambiguity. The nuclear holdouts' instinctive aversion to transparency and minimal experience with the habits and practices of compliance with arms control and nonproliferation agreements create signifi cant obstacles for supporters of nuclear disarmament. The remainder of this chapter unfolds in the following way. The next section provides a brief overview of the nuclear- weapon and delivery capabilities, strategic postures, and historical disarmament diplomacy of India, Israel, and Pakistan. Section three describes the holdout states' reactions and responses to the vision of a world without nuclear weapons articulated by U.S. president Barack Obama during his April 2009 speech in Prague.6 The fourth section discusses the prospects for future Indian, Israeli, and Pakistani disarmament policy and diplomacy and then off ers a number of recommendations for the disarmament community. © 2012 by the University of Georgia Press.

This logic seems strange since neither the United States nor the frequently quoted “inter na tional com mun ity�?seem to have a convincing strat egy for preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Some speculate that Washington has even tacitly accepted the idea that Iran will succeed in its nuclear efforts, as there are hardly any options by which to prevent this outcome. Compared to the incalculable risks of a milit ary strike against nuclear production sites, acquiescing to the idea of Iran possessing of nuclear weapons appears to be the lesser of two evils. The United States is not alone in exhibiting ambiguity with respect to Iran’s pro gress towards the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Most of the United States’ Euro pean allies show the same level of ambivalence. They characterize Iran’s nuclear efforts as a major threat to inter na tional stability and at the same time they agree on no more than half-hearted sanc tions and they have no vision of how to proceed if the efforts to keep Iran from going nuclear fail. Countries like the Russian Federation or the People’s Repub lic of China are even worse as they not only under mine attempts to achieve inter na tional consensus re gard ing Iran in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) but, in Moscow’s case, they also do not hesitate to con tinue to deliver crit ical tech no logy to the theocratic regime in Tehran. Since the failure of the inter na tional efforts to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons is a realistic pro spect, it is crucial that we ana lyse what the con- sequences will be, if Tehran one day cred ibly dem on strates-for instance by a nuclear test-that it has or can rapidly assemble nuclear weapons. This is not a new-question;-it-was-already-identified-before-the-terrorist-attacks-of-11-Septem- ber 2001 (Schake and Yaphe 2001). Since that time, though, the situ ation has changed in a number of respects. The tragedy of 9/11 focused inter na tional attention on the dangers of jihadist terrorism; the Democratic People’s Repub lic of Korea (North Korea) joined the “nuclear club�? by way of (more or less) success-ful nuclear weapon tests; hopes for peaceful regime change in Iran have not come true; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is in a pro cess of funda mentally reassessing its roles and missions, which will also include adapta- tions-of-its-nuclearstrategy;-and-finally, the-dream-of-a-world-free-of- nuclear- weapons has made its way onto the agenda at the highest polit ical levels of the Atlantic alliance. Hence, it is prudent today to ask again: what are the im plica tions of a nuclear- armed Iran for the region, for inter na tional pol itics and for the nuclear deterrence strat egy of NATO? For sure, answering this question requires that a number of as-sump-tions-be-clarified:-what-kind-of-a-regime-governs-Iran?Is-Iranian-foreign- pol-icy- offensive-or- defensive?- What- are- the- technical-speci-fica-tions-of-the-Iranian nuclear programme? Are major allies sup porting Iran or is it acting on its own? (North Korea still enjoys some patronage-even if hesitant-from China.) Intentionally sim plifying the issue, this ana lysis skips many of these facets and vari ables and asks: how to live with a nuclear Iran-assuming that the extremist and anti- democratic regime in Tehran con tinues in power? Three aspects will be dealt with in detail: (1) What could the imme diate threats be? (2) What are the broader im plica tions? (3) What needs to be done from NATO’s point of view to cope with the worrisome reality that Iran has achieved the status of a nuclear player in inter na tional politics?. © 2012 Joachim Krause.",,,,,,,,,,"Bunn, E., Can Deterrence Be Tailored?

Pundits and policymakers in both the United States and Japan contemplated the implications of Pyongyang's nuclear breakout, and many wondered if this marked the beginning of fundamental change in Japanese thinking on these issues. Just as North Korea's long-range missile test over Japanese airspace in 1998 contributed significantly to Japan's decision a few years later to embrace America's missile defense development program, might the nuclear tests eventually prove to be a similar watershed moment in Japanese defense policy? Would there be a rising tide of Japanese sentiment in favor of reexamining the Three Non-Nuclear Principles of nonpossession, nonmanufacture, and nonintroduction? The short answer to the nuclear question in Japan is ""no."" There is little evidence to suggest that Japan has notably more interest in developing an indigenous nuclear deterrent as a result of North Korea's tests, and Japan has not taken steps to shorten its theoretical lead time for launching a domestic nuclear weapons program.1 The perceived threats are not sufficient to warrant such a dramatic policy shift, and Japan's alliance with the United States is still considered up to the challenges at hand. Moreover, Japanese nuclear weapons development has been even less likely in the near term since the more liberal, pacifist-influenced Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) came to power after winning a historic election in September 2009. The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster of course did nothing to cure the Japanese people's nuclear allergy. North Korea's nuclear tests and continuing missile programs are, however, examples of Japan's eroding security position in the region, and they contribute to a growing sense of vulnerability among the defense policy elite in Japan. These anxieties are compounded by China's military modernization, its space exploration, and its rising economic and diplomatic influence in the region. Japan has always been dependent on energy imports, which constitute about 94 percent of its primary energy supply, but its reliance on food imports is also high (more than 60 percent of its calorie intake), and instability in the Middle East and the rising share of food imports from China have exacerbated Tokyo's unease. For more than half a century, Japan's alliance with the United States has helped to mitigate these uncertainties, and the so-called US nuclear umbrella has been a primary symbol of America's commitment to regional security and Japan's defense. Japanese perceptions of extended deterrence are changing subtly, however, as both the regional security landscape and Japanese domestic politics undergo transformation. The monopoly on policymaking long held by high-level bureaucrats and conservative politicians in Japan broke apart dramatically when the DPJ assumed the reins of government in late 2009, giving greater voice to left-leaning and populist leaders. Where policy insiders once worried most about a possible US abandonment of Japan and its core interests, prevailing public concerns about Japan's becoming entangled in US foreign policy adventurism and conflict abroad now carry more weight. Meanwhile, Japan's wariness about China's rising power lies just below the surface, which contributes to fluid and unpredictable attitudes toward deterrence and the role of the United States-Japan alliance. Unsurprisingly, the North Korean nuclear tests and domestic political change in South Korea have also affected perceptions of extended deterrence in America's other major Northeast Asian ally. For decades, South Korea's top security concern was an overwhelming lightning strike by North Korea's massive army. Forward-deployed US conventional and tactical nuclear forces were a vital component of the allies' deterrent strategy. This was less of a nuclear ""umbrella"" than it was a nuclear ""spear"" to deter and, if necessary, defeat a North Korean ground assault. US tactical nuclear weapons represented an integral part of the allies' plan to defend Seoul in the 1960s and 1970s, when North Korea maintained a sizable conventional military advantage. As the United States and South Korea strengthened their conventional capabilities vis-à -vis North Korea's military infrastructure in the 1980s and early 1990s, it became possible for the United States to withdraw all its nuclear weapons from South Korean territory. Seoul's liberal governments in the late 1990s and early 2000s voiced fewer and fewer concerns about US abandonment compared with earlier years, and Seoul sought to reduce the country's dependence on Washington for deterrence support. More recently, however, the pendulum has swung back again. North Korean nuclear gains have prompted calls in the South for the United States to reaffirm its nuclear umbrella. By the late 2000s the newly elected conservative administration of Lee Myung-bak was emphasizing the importance not only of the US nuclear umbrella but also of possibly enhancing the nation's ""nuclear sovereignty"" by expanding its control over the nuclear fuel cycle. This ostensibly constituted a move to earn the right to reprocess spent nuclear fuel and reduce waste, but some considered it an initial hedge in case Seoul one day determined that the country needed an indigenous nuclear deterrent. It is common within alliances for countries to struggle with the tension between fears of abandonment and fears of entanglement. This has been abundantly true in East Asia. Where a country resides on that spectrum often informs its decision making at critical junctures, whether it means allowing the introduction of US nuclear weapons to its ports or its soil or insisting on greater political and operational distance between the partners. For many years since the late 1990s, Japan worried more about abandonment than entanglement when it came to tough deterrence questions. South Korea tilted in the other direction. More recently, the allies' perceptions have seemingly moved in opposite directions. It is important to understand why this is the case, how significant and lasting a change this could be, and what it implies for deterrence in the region. To get some perspective on the answers to these questions, it is helpful to review the history of deterrence debates in both countries. For a variety of reasons, this chapter focuses on Japan as the critical path for nuclear deterrence in the region. The US nuclear umbrella over South Korea remains important-increasingly so, in fact-but the political sensitivity associated with extended deterrence is higher in Japan. It takes more effort to reassure Tokyo, whereas South Korea enjoys options for defense spending and offensive strike that Japan has denied itself based on how it interprets its Constitution. Theoretical contingencies involving nuclear weapons are more numerous in the Japanese case (involving China, North Korea, and even Russia), whereas South Korean scenarios typically involve only North Korea. Seoul is inherently reluctant to use nuclear weapons on Korean soil, moreover, especially now that the allies enjoy qualitative conventional superiority. A major reason why South Korean scenarios mainly involve North Korea is because US forces on the peninsula do not enjoy the same strategic flexibility they do in Japan, and this will remain true for the foreseeable future. This exposes the United States-Japan alliance to wedge strategies. An adversary could threaten the use of nuclear weapons as a means of intimidating Tokyo. One plausible scenario would see China resort to nuclear saber rattling to discourage Japanese leaders from consenting to the use of American air assets from Kadena Air Force Base in a Taiwan contingency. A US nuclear posture sufficient for deterrence and for defending Japan, then, should also satisfy Washington's other allies in the region; but the reverse is not necessarily true. This dynamic will likely persist, but changing perceptions of deterrence in Northeast Asia could challenge long-held assumptions. © 2012 Georgetown University Press.",,,,,,,,,,"Energy for Japan 2008, , www.enecho.meti.go.jp/topics/hakusho/2008/index.htm, (in Japanese); The Great East Japan Earthquake: MAFF's Information, , www.maff.go.jp/j/zyukyu/zikyu_ritu/011.html, (in Japanese); South Korea may need its own deterrent (2009) Chosun Ilbo, , (Digital Chosun), May 26; Memo: Sato said ban on nukes was mistake (2010) Yomiuri Shimbun, , (Daily Yomiuri Online), March 11; Japan-US secret pacts confirmed, government policy shift expected (2010) Kyodo News Agency, , March 9; Jameson, S., Foreign minister says Japan will need nuclear arms if North Korea threatens (1993) Los Angeles Times, , July 29; Campbell, K.M., Sunohara, T., Japan: Thinking the unthinkable (2004) The Nuclear Tipping Point: Why States Reconsider their Nuclear Choices, p. 222. , edited by Kurt M.

Since 1991 gravity bombs, deliverable by US and allied dual-capable aircraft, have been the only type of US nuclear weapons left in Europe. Although many other factors are involved in the alliance's deterrence posture and in US extended deterrence-including intercontinental forces, missile defences, non-nuclear capabilities and declaratory policy-recent discussions in the United States about NATO nuclear deterrence have focused on the future of the remaining US nuclear weapons in Europe. The traditional view has supported long-standing US and NATO policy in holding that the risk- and responsibility-sharing arrangements based on US nuclear weapons in Europe contribute to deterrence and war prevention; provide assurance to the allies of the genuineness of US commitments; and make the extended deterrence responsibility more acceptable to the United States. From this perspective, no further cuts in the US nuclear weapons presence in Europe should be made without an agreement with Russia providing for reductions that address the US-Russian numerical disparity in non-strategic nuclear forces, with reciprocal transparency and verification measures. In contrast, four schools of thought call for withdrawing the remaining US nuclear weapons in Europe without any negotiated Russian reciprocity: some military officers who consider the weapons and associated arrangements unnecessary for deterrence; proponents of ambitious arms control measures who accept extended deterrence policies but view the US weapons in Europe as an obstacle to progress in disarmament; nuclear disarmament champions who reject extended nuclear deterrence policies and who wish to eliminate all nuclear arms promptly; and selective engagement campaigners who want the United States to abandon extended nuclear deterrence commitments to allies on the grounds that they could lead to US involvement in a nuclear war. © 2011 The Author(s).

Jean-Louis Gergorin suggested nearly 20 years ago that the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction could result in 'the at least partial sanctuarization of powers seeking to practise regional expansionism without the intervention of the great powers and the international community': Jean-Louis Gergorin, 'Deterrence in the post-Cold War era', in New dimensions in international security, part II, Adelphi Paper 266 (London: Brassey's for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 1992); The political and practical challenges to organizing such a NATO DCA wing have yet to be thoroughly examined. The same holds true of other innovative concepts, such as training and certifying for nuclear missions aircrews from NNWS allies that lack DCA. Some supporters of the traditional view hold that new operational, technical and financial means of nuclear risk- and responsibility-sharing deserve further investigation; (2008), p. 59. , http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/PhaseIIReportFinal.pdf, 'Deployed weapons in Europe have been reduced by more than 97 per cent since their peak in the 1970s': James R.

In the late 1970s West German officials insisted that NNWS allies in Europe other than West Germany should serve as hosts for projected deployments of US INF missiles lest West Germany be 'singularized'. The West Germans meant that they did not want to bear the burden of responsibility all by themselves, lest they aggravate their domestic political problems and become a clearer target for Soviet diplomatic pressure.

Geographical constraints on the storage and deployment of non-strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems could almost certainly be circumvented for similar reasons, especially the ease with which these capabilities could be relocated. While there is no question of establishing a ban on US and Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future, many experts judge that, to be effective, numerical limitations on these US and Russian weapons would have to be global.

The question today is: Has the concept of deterrence outlived its usefulness? In Beyond Nuclear Deterrence, two of Russia's top nonproliferation and international security experts, Alexei Arbatov and Vladimir Dvorkin, critically assess the history of deterrence as it emerged between the Soviet Union and the U.S. and evolved through the Cold War to include an expanding nuclear club. The authors argue that while deterrence as a concept has always been paradoxical, it is poorly equipped to handle today's most significant nuclear challenges: proliferation and terrorism. Nuclear arms control must move beyond the deadlock of deterrence. The U.S. and Russia need to take the first bilateral steps to remove mutual nuclear deterrence as the foundation of their strategic relationship and implement changes that can be exported internationally. © 2006 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Today, there is a chance to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Arctic. The Antarctic Treaty offers a model for demilitarisation. The establishment of nuclear-free zones in other regions of the world made it possible that nuclear states do not have to take the initiative.

In the succeeding decades, the U.S. Armed Forces and the German Bundeswehr have gone predictably separate ways. America's legions returned home. For those that remained, Germany became an administrative zone and a rear echelon for operations further afield. The Bundeswehr reconfigured its force structure, personnel policies, and mission concepts in response to regional and global circumstances inconceivable in the era of the Federal Republic. Their four decades of close association nevertheless remain a significant case study in successful, long-term relations between armed forces with significantly different matrices and focuses. The U.S. presence in what became the Federal Republic of Germany, for all its wider social impacts, began as a military occupation and endured for a military purpose. NATO existed, as the saying went, “to keep the Americans in, the Germans down, and the Russians out.” For almost forty years, NATO's linchpins were the U.S. garrison of West Germany and the Federal Republic's Bundeswehr. For all the elaborate theoretical and polemical structures that grew up around them, nuclear deterrence, mutual assured destruction, and the rest were exercises in shadowboxing. A nuclear war in Europe could not be fought – only finessed. As events in Europe and the world continue to demonstrate, sovereignty is ultimately defended by placing young adults armed with rifles on the ground to defend. And when all the fine words about Atlantic community and Western solidarity were spoken, it was the West Germans, and the GIs who stood with them, that gave ultimate credibility to an alliance whose other armies, like the French, were usually otherwise engaged; like the British, lacked sustainability; or, like the rest, were Warsaw Pact breakthroughs waiting to happen. © German Historical Institute 2013.",,,,,,,,,,"Faerhrmann, I., (2010) Die Bundeswehr im Einsatz für Europa: Die Beteiligung Deutschl and s an der Gemeinsamen Sicherheits-und Verteidigungsspolitik (GSVP)-Zulässigkeit nach dem Vertrag von Lissabon, , Baden-Baden, Germany, is a recent introduction; Willoughby, J., (2001) Remaking the Conquering Heroes: The Postwar American Occupation of Germany, , New York; Goede, P., (2003) GIs and Germans: Culture, Gender, and Foreign Relations, , New Haven, CT; Höhn, M., (2001) GIs and Frauleins: The German-American Encounter in 1950s West Germany, , Chapel Hill, NC; Friedman, N., (2000) The Fifty-YearWar: Conflict and Strategy in the ColdWar, , Annapolis, MD; Gaddis, J.L., (1999) Cold War Statesmen Confront the Bomb: Nuclear Diplomacy since 1945, , New York; Bessel, R., (2009) Germany 1945, , New York; Muller, C.H., (2010) West Germany against the West: Anti-American Public Opinion in the Federal Republic of Germany, 1949-68, , New York; Gall, L., Die Bundesrepublik in der kontinuität der deutschen Geschichte (1984) Historische Zeitschtrift, 239, pp. 605-613; Finszsch, N., Martschukat, J., (1996) Different Restorations: Reconstruction and Wiederaufbau in the United States and Germany, 1865, 1945-1989, , eds, Providence, RI; Brockman, S., Trommler, F., (1996) Revisiting Zero Hour 1945: The Emergence of Postwar German Culture, , eds, Washington, DC; Berghahn, V., (1966) Der Stahlhelm: Bund der Frontsoldaten, 1918-1935, , Düsseldorf, Germany; Diehl, J., (1977) Paramilitary Politics in the Weimar Republic, , Bloomington, IN; Diehl, J., (1997) The Thanks of the Fatherl and: German Veterans after the Second World War, , Chapel Hill, NC; Lockenour, J., (2001) Soldiers as Citizens: Former Wehrmacht Officers in the Federal Republic of Germany, , Lincoln, NE; Zehfuss, M., (2007) Wounds of Memory: The Politics of War in Germany, , New York; Muller, C.H., (2010) West Germany against the West: Anti-American Public Opinion in the Federal Republic of Germany, 1949-68, , New York; Wettig, G., (1967) Entmilitarisierung und Wiederbewaffnung in Deutschl and, 1943-1955, , Munich; Foerster, R.G., (1982) Anfänge westdeutscher Sicherheitspolitik 1945-1956, vol.

It also contains novel, genuinely cooperative rules for the verification of the reductions. Both qualities are needed to bring comprehensive nuclear disarmament nearer. Further reductions may lead to a worldwide drawdown of nuclear arsenals to the quantities required for minimum deterrence. And practical experience with cooperative verification routines may allow the creation of the confidence needed to compel further reductions. In this light, the experience gained with a special status of non-deployed weapons may even play a positive role. On the debit side of the balance is the loss of detailed, confidence-boosting verification practices of the START era, although these are balanced by novel verification rules. The results are robust, but the negotiations took longer than expected as a result of what seemed to be internal political struggles. Follow-on negotiations may become tougher. New START does not answer the question whether the Russian Federation will become just a regional nuclear power, adapting to a changing strategic environment. How will its new nuclear order of battle affect strategic stability? Will it rely more rather than less on nuclear deterrence? Formal arms control cannot solve these questions, but will ultimately be judged with these questions in mind. © Oxford University Press 2010; all rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/04/08/new-start-treaty-and-protocol, Treaty between the USA and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms; Note; Note; Monitoring a Nuclear Weapon from the Inside: Embedded Sensors Could Help Transform Stockpile Stewardship (2008) Sci Tech Rev, p. 15. , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, (inset); Note; Feith, D.J., Shulsky, A.N., Why Revive the Cold War?

Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, Columbia University, NY, United States","In recent considerations of deterrence in strategic studies, there are almost no works that would systematically link deterrence to one of the most important current issue areas of contemporary strategic studies: ballistic missile defence (BMD). In an attempt to address this lacuna, this article considers ways in which missile defence has been - and can be - intertwined with deterrence of the 21st century. The article begins with a historical outline of the relationship between nuclear deterrence and BMD, and continues by comparing and contrasting US political and strategic-planning discourses in how they have addressed the examined relationship. What follows is the recasting of traditional understanding of deterrence as a set of disparate modalities underpinned by different principles and organizing logics. The article will show the role and function of BMD in three relevant modalities of deterrence in the 21st century: first, in a renewed strategic deterrence between the USA and Russia based on an axiomatic logic of MAD; second, in the deterrence of rogue states in reaction to their asymmetric nuclear threats; and, finally, in a reverse deterrence from intervention in regional conflicts. Consequently, the presented outline of the three modalities will be theoretically furthered to allow for conceptualization of possible links to BMD in ways in which practical implications for future research, strategic planning and political action can be seen. © The Author(s), 2010.","China; compellence; deterrence; missile defence; Russia; USA",,,,,,,,,"Betts, R.K., What Will It Take To Deter the United States?

The force sizes for Russia and the US will be set at significantly lower than-SORT and present START levels in order to provide meaningful tests for the null hypothesis. Smaller Russian and American strategic nuclear forces can be important incentives for restraint by existing nuclear weapons states, and for international cooperation in preventing the growth of additional nuclear weapons states.",,"armed forces; conflict management; hypothesis testing; leadership; nuclear weapon; political violence; strategic approach; weaponry; Russian Federation; United States",,,,,,,,"Arbatov, A., Gottemoeller, R., New Presidents, New Agreements?

In March 2008 the government released its National Security Strategy that stressed the long-term complexity, diversity and interdependence of threats to British security with a clear focus on human rights, justice and freedom. This article asks how the threat to kill tens if not hundreds of thousands of people with British nuclear weapons fits into the National Security Strategy's world view and questions the relevance of an instrument of such devastating bluntness to threats defined by complexity and interdependence. It argues that the government's case for replacing the current Trident system based on the logic of nuclear deterrence is flawed. First, Britain faces no strategic nuclear threats and the long-term post-Cold War trend in relations with Russia and China - the two nuclear-armed major powers that could conceivably threaten the UK with nuclear attack - is positive, despite current tensions with Moscow over Georgia. Second, the credibility and legitimacy of threatening nuclear destruction in response to the use of WMD by 'rogue' states is highly questionable and British nuclear threats offer no 'insurance' or guarantee of protection against future 'rogue' nuclear threats. Third, nuclear weapons have no role to play in deterring acts of nuclear terrorism whether state-sponsored or not. Fourth, British nuclear threats will be useless in dealing with complex future conflicts characterized by 'hybrid' wars and diverse and interdependent sources of insecurity. The article concludes by arguing that the government's fall-back position that it must keep nuclear weapons 'just in case' because the future security environment appears so uncertain, makes no sense if British nuclear threats offer no solution to the causes and symptoms of that uncertainty. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/The Royal Institute of International Affairs.",,,,,,,,,,"Quinlan, M., The future of nuclear weapons: Policy for western possessors (1993) International Affairs, 69 (3), p. 496. , p.

It will use as its starting point the parameters for UK strategic nuclear targeting, and the foundation of the 'Moscow Criterion', prior to the deployment of Britain's Polaris submarines which began in 1968. It will then discuss the recommendation by the Chiefs of Staff to retarget Polaris in 1975/76 and the implications of that recommendation in terms of the British approach to strategic nuclear deterrence. The article will conclude with an assessment of these retargeting decisions on the decision to replace Polaris with the US Trident system in 1980.","Chevaline; Nuclear; Targeting","decision analysis; historical geography; historical perspective; nuclear power; political history; strategic approach; targeting; Eurasia; Europe; Moscow [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; United Kingdom; Western Europe",,,,,,,,"(1986) Strategic Nuclear Targeting, , Cornell UP, Ithaca, NY; Baylis, J., Stoddart, K., Chevaline: The Hidden Programme, 1967-1982 (2003) Journal of Strategic Studies, 263, pp. 124-155; Baylis, J., British Nuclear Doctrine: The ""Moscow Criterion"" and the Polaris Improvement Programme (2005) Contemporary British History, 191, pp. 53-65; Baylis, J., (1995) Ambiguity and Deterrence: British Nuclear Strategy, 1945-1964, , Clarendon Press, Oxford; Bomber Command 1960s UK Space Conference Charterhouse, Surrey, UK, , Brocklebank, Sqn Ldr R. presentation made at the; Burr, W., NSA Website, 'The Creation of SIOP 62'; Burr, W., The Nixon Administration, the SIOP and the Search for Limited Nuclear Options, 1969-1974; (2007), 'Cabinets and the Bomb' Workshop, held at the British Academy; Callaghan, J., (1987) Time and Chance, , Collins, London; Carver, M., (1989) Out of Step: The Memories of Field Marshal Lord Carver, , Hutchinson, London; Clark, I., Wheeler, N., (1989) The British Origins of Nuclear Strategy 1945-1955, , OUP, Oxford; Clark, I., (1994) Nuclear Diplomacy and the Special Relationship, , Clarendon Press, Oxford; (1980) Defence Open Government Document 80/23, , HMSO, London; Freedman, L., (1980) Britain and Nuclear Weapons, , Macmillan, Basingstoke; Freedman, L., British Nuclear Targeting (1985) Defence Analysis, 12, pp. 81-99; Freedman, L., (1989) The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy, , Macmillan, Basingstoke; Healey, D., (1990) The Time of My Life, , Penguin, London; Hennessy, P., (1997) Muddling Through: Power, Politics and the Quality of Government in Post-war Britain, , Indigo, London; Hennessy, P., (2002) The Secret State: Whitehall and the Cold War, , Penguin, London; Hennessy, P., (2007) Cabinets and the Bomb, , OUP, Oxford; Jackson, B., Bramall, D., (1992) The Chiefs: The Story of the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff, , Brassey's, London; Kemp, G., Nuclear Forces for Medium Powers: Part 1: Targets and Weapons Systems (1974) Adelphi Papers, p. 106; Kemp, G., Nuclear Forces for Medium Powers Parts II and III: Strategic Requirements and Options (1974) Adelphi Papers, p. 107; (1974), Labour Party Manifesto; (1982) Ministry of Defence: Chevaline Improvement to the Polaris Missile System, , HMSO, London; Moore, R., A JIGSAW Puzzle for Operations Researchers: British Global War Studies, 1954-1962 (1997) Journal of Strategic Studies, 202, pp. 75-91; Owen, D., (1992) Time to Declare, , Penguin, London; Panton, F., Polaris Improvements and the Chevaline System 1967-1975/6 (2004) Prospero Proceedings from the British Rocket Oral History Conferences at Charterhouse, p. 1; Pierre, A., (1972) Nuclear Politics: The British Experience With an Independent Strategic Force 1939-70, , OUP, Oxford; Podvig, P., History and the Current Status of the Russian Early Warning System (2002) Science and Global Security, 101, pp. 21-60; (2004) Proceedings from a Conference on The History of the UK Strategic Deterrent: The Chevaline Programme, , held at the Royal Aeronautical Society (Royal Aeronautical Society); Rosenberg, D.A., The Origins of Overkill: Nuclear Weapons and American Strategy, 1945-1960 (1983) International Security, 7, pp. 3-71; Smart, I., British Foreign Policy to 1985: The Future of the British Nuclear Deterrent: Technical, Economic and Strategic Issues (1977) International Affairs, 534, pp. 557-571; Stoddart, K., The Sword and the Shield: Nuclear Weapons and International Security Since 1945, Volume 4, 1970-1976, , Palgrave, Basingstoke; Twigge, S., Scott, L., (2000) Planning Armageddon: Britain, the United States and the Command of Western Nuclear Forces, 1945-1964, , Harwood, Amsterdam","Stoddart, K.; Mountbatten Centre for International Studies, , Southampton, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,01402390,,,,"English","J.

See Derek Parfit, Reasons and Persons, chap. 16. Nearly any major public policy affects who is born and who is not. If we rely on nuclear weapons, different people will be born than if we had relied on conventional deterrence instead. Hence, even if this leads to disaster, so long as postwar people find their lives even minimally worth living, we will not be able to identify specific individuals whom nuclear weapons have harmed. Philosophers have suggested a variety of responses to the non-identity problem. Perhaps the best response is that it violates our basic moral intuitions. It means, for example, that squandering resources harms no one in the far future, since different people will be born than if we conserve. Such claims, as Parfit himself says, are scarcely plausible. Ibid, 378. In any case, for the non-identity problem to apply, future people must find life worth living.

Some claim that people that do not yet exist cannot have rights e.g, Beckerman and Pasek, Justice, Posterity and the Environment, Yet a terrorist who sets a time bomb that kills a dozen children eighty years later violates their rights even though the children were not born when the bomb was set and the bomb-maker is no longer alive when it goes off. Even an unborn child, as Joel Feinberg points out, can have the right to property, contingent upon his birth, and instantly voidable if he dies before birth, Assuming that the child will be born, the law seems to say, various interests that he will come to have after birth must be protected from damage that they can incur even before birth.

One might argue that people in the far future will not belong to the same nation, and that states therefore owe a greater obligation to the next few generations. Reasoning along communitarian lines, Avner de-Shalit holds that our positive obligations to future people diminish as they become more distant. Nevertheless, he holds that to people of the very remote future we have a strong 'negative' obligation - namely, to avoid causing them enormous harm or bringing them death, and to try and relieve any potential and foreseeable distress; De-Shalit, Why Posterity Matters, 13, 54, 63-65, quotation from 13. Nuclear deterrence flunks this test. The exception might be if a state's enemies are bent on genocide. Suppose Israelis fear that in the absence of nuclear weapons their enemies would murder the Israeli nation. If they are right, then nuclear deterrence could serve the interests even of future generations of Israelis. Despite the near-inevitability of eventual nuclear war, Israelis might consider this a lesser risk than that of Arab genocide. Before acting on such a conclusion, Israel should explore every conceivable alternative, including a conventional military build-up, appeasing the Arabs or even shutting down the Zionist enterprise and moving to other parts of the world. If none of these is a feasible means of securing Israelis' physical survival, then building a small nuclear arsenal might be justified; Shue, H., Liberalism: The Impossibility of Justifying Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004) Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction: Religious and Secular Perspectives, pp. 139-162. , For an insightful discussion, see, ed.

While arguing that cheating would likely have little strategic impact if the other state's forces were invulnerable, Ullman opposes cuts to very low levels, chiefly on the grounds that the discovery of cheating could bring on a crisis in the domestic politics of the detecting state. Yet the result would almost certainly not be war but an arms build-up. Political tensions would rise, but deterrence should remain stable. Given the importance of deep cuts for limiting damage, this seems a risk well worth taking; Ghosh, P.K., Deterrence Asymmetry and Other Challenges to Small Nuclear Forces (2004) Contemporary Security Policy, 25 (1), p. 43. , April; While warning that Russia's existing deterrent is becoming increasingly vulnerable, Lieber and Press note Russia could keep 50 mobile missiles on continuous peacetime alert or substantially increase its nuclear submarine patrols. Either step would dramatically reduce Russia's vulnerability. They argue that it would be hard for Moscow to do this. Lieber and Press, The End of MAD? 34.

The topic is rapidly re-emerging as one of ever-greater relevance and policy-strategic urgency. A more fluid international order, the complexity of post-Cold War security issues, and the pressure of incipient nuclear proliferation in Asia, make clarity in American-Russian nuclear arms control of first importance. Through the revival of proven analytical techniques, however, this article self-consciously reintroduces concepts long at the heart of strategic nuclear debates. These show that although there is no imminent risk to first strike stability, arms control stability is more nuanced and cannot be assumed without deliberate effort. Missile defences, already deployed by the US and possibly appealing to others, may further complicate the stabilisation of Russian-American nuclear security relations and the containment of nuclear arms races in Asia. Strategic stability is not as important as before for immediate human survival, nor does it raise a significant danger of Russian-American confrontation, and certainly not a risk of pre-emptive attack. The strategic balance, rather, remains a precondition to cooperation on other issues, above all nuclear proliferation. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cimbala, S.J.; Pennsylvania State University, Delaware County, United States",,,,,,,,13523260,,,,"English","Contemp.

From this perspective, the nuclear deterrence and the concept of balance of powers seemed outdated. However, today the United States is facing new threats ; in order to combat them, the new nuclear policy, praised by the American army, recommends that the nuclear arsenal be modernized so that the president may have at his disposal a complete set of weapons, allowing him to deter all attempts of assault. Therefore, the eventuality of the use of nuclear weapons is trivialized, and efforts at deterrence are weakened. Although the Russian-American agreement, signed in Moscow on the 24th of May 2002, looked like a disarmament agreement, it does not prevent the two countries from continuing to developing their arsenal. Thus, in the century to come, the American arsenal will be maintained at the same level as that reached by the end of the Cold War.",,,,,,,,,,"Le 23 mai 2000, George W.

The dealerters’ rationale is that, by removing strategic systems from an alleged “hair‐trigger” posture, these measures would reduce the risks of catastrophic accidents and would give U.S. and Russian political authorities more time to make critical decisions during crises. Largely the product of U.S. arms‐control advocates, dealerting proposals seek a radical “quick fix” to the evolutionary START process and represent a dangerous “back door” to nuclear disarmament. As this article demonstrates, dealerting schemes are risky formulas for undermining a prudent U.S. deterrent posture that emphasizes, above all, the safety and security of its nuclear forces. The article focuses on the deleterious potential impact of these proposals on the Trident nuclear‐powered ballistic‐missile submarine force that is shouldering an increasing burden of U.S. nuclear‐deterrence requirements. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,,,"Cohen, W.S., (1999) Annual Report to the President and the Congress, p. 67. , Washington, DC: GPO; Hamilton, L.H., (1995) U.S. Nuclear Policy: Hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, p. 80. , 5 October 1994, Washington, DC: GPO, appendix 2; Mann, P., Ukrainian SS-24s Slated for Prompt Deactivation (1994) Aviation Week & Space Technology, p. 39. , 24 January; Factfile: Comparison of U.S. And Soviet Nuclear Cuts (1991) Arms Control Today, pp. 27-28. , November; Bailey, K.C., Barish, F.D., Dealerting of U.S. Nuclear Forces: A Critical Appraisal Comparative Strategy, 18 (1), pp. 5-6; Bunn, M., Bush and Yeltsin Press New Nuclear Cutbacks (1992) Arms Control Today, p. 48. , January/February; Galeotti, M., Crisis Continues for Russia's Army (1998) Jane's Intelligence Review, p. 4. , June; Renfrew, B., Precarious Finances in Russia Leave Nuclear Arsenal Crumbling (1999) Associated Press, , http://nt.excite.com/ntd.gw?page=show&topic=BMD, 12 Feb; Hoffman, D., Harris, J., Yeltsin Warning Stirs a Temporary Tempest (1999) Washington Post, pp. A1. , 10 April; Krivokhidja, V.I., Kuznetsov, E.N., Nikolaichik, I.A., (1994) START II: Problems and Solutions, p. 47. , Moscow: Russian Institute of Strategic Studies; Falichev, O., The War Doctrine Reconsidered: Interview with the Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev (1999) Parlamentskaya Gazeta, p. 1. , 27 April; Hoffman, D., Kremlin to Bolster Nuclear Stockpile (1999) Washington Post, pp. A19. , 30 April; Budavinov, I., Safronov, I., Yelstin Orders Nuclear Shield to be Patched Up (1999) Kommersant, p. 1. , 30 April; Hoffman, D., Downsizing a Mighty Arsenal (1998) Washington Post Foreign Service, pp. A-1. , http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/Wplate/1998-03/16/1031-031698-idx.html, 16 March; Wilkening, D., (1998) The Evolution of Russia's Strategic Nuclear Force, p. 42. , Stanford, CA: Center for International Security and Arms Control, July; Korotchenko, I., We Maintain High Battle Potential (1997) Nezavisimoe Voennoe Obozrenie, (46). , 20 December; Lobodenko, V., Ponomaryev, N., Spiridonov, Y., Tsyba, Y., We Have Forgotten About Radio-Electronic Warfare (1998) Nezavisimoe Voennoe Obozrenie, (24-3), p. 4. , July; Bulavinov, I., Safronov, I., Nuclear Force Self-Destructs (1998) Kommersant Daily, p. 3. , 24 October; Sokov, N., (1998) Modernization of Strategic Nuclear Weapons in Russia: The Emerging New Posture, p. 31. , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Davis Center for Russian Studies; Golotyuk, Y., On the Other Hand, We Do Make Missiles: Russia's Nuclear Forces Being Equipped With 'Terminators (1999) Izvestiya, p. 1. , 5 June, FBIS doc. no.

This study tests a variety of reduced US and Russian nuclear forces, including hypothetical forces and START configurations, for their relative force advantage and for their ability to fulfil previously accepted standards of assured retaliation. It turns out that, as forces decrease towards very low levels, the Russian force falls behind the US force in operational flexibility and becomes much more vulnerable to surprise strikes without warning. Both forces maintain the ability to inflict historically unprecedented retaliatory damage even at the 1,000 warhead level, the lowest included here. The good news is that minimum deterrent forces rapidly run out of plausible targets, making them irrelevant for counterforce first strikes or for escalation dominance. The bad news is that minimum forces can become exclusively city attacking forces by default. Former adversaries now turned into potential partners in search of regional and global stability, the USA and Russia must safeguard the transition from a nuclear deterrence regime to a more disarmed world. The reduction of US and Russian arsenals to several hundreds of weapons is contributory to stability on the assumption that the British, French and Chinese nuclear weapons inventories undergo proportionate reductions also. A second assumption built into favorable prognoses for US and Russian reductions well below START levels is that nuclear proliferation can be constrained. Absent constrained proliferation and cooperative European and Asian nuclear powers, US and Russian force reductions below 1,000 warheads are ambiguously stable. Neorealist arguments in favor of well-managed proliferation understate the extent to which Cold War stability was overdetermined. US-Soviet nuclear deterrence rested on a substructure that included bipolarity and learned behavior modification for crisis management. © 1995, Sage Publications.

Russia does not concede that its security interests should be limited by its boundaries, since there is no feasible alternative to Russian peacekeeping activities in unstable areas like the Caucasus and Central Asia. Russia relys more on a doctrine of nuclear deterrence; thus, the absence of no-first-use obligation. Still, the new doctrine leaves open the possibility for unprovoked military buildup.
