J	Evans, CP				Evans, Christopher P.			Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND): a good faith, effective measure pursuant to Article VI NPT or empty gesturing?	CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th CILJ Annual Cambridge International Law Conference	APR 30-MAY 02, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Cambridge Int Law Journal		NPT; nuclear weapons; CEND; disarmament; good faith	NONPROLIFERATION TREATY; NON-PROLIFERATION; FORCES; NEGOTIATION; WEAPONS	It has been 50 years since the adoption of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which established the obligation upon all States Parties to work towards nuclear disarmament under Article VI. Yet, despite extensive reductions in nuclear weapons stockpiles since the Cold War peaks, nuclear arms control and disarmament efforts are currently in disarray. After the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was terminated in 2019, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty remains as the only bilateral limitation on United States (US) and Russian nuclear forces in operation and is due to expire in February 2021. The US has justified its limited nuclear disarmament progress on the premise that the current international security environment is not conducive to further nuclear disarmament. Instead, the US has recently promoted a new initiative called Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND). The initiative aims to provide a platform for all States to engage in constructive dialogue to identify ways to improve the international security environment, which make nuclear deterrence necessary while addressing the hurdles that currently impede progress towards nuclear disarmament. Significantly, the US regards CEND as an 'effective measure' and an illustration of its commitment towards disarmament under Article VI. This article seeks to address the US claim that CEND represents a good faith, effective measure towards nuclear disarmament pursuant to Article VI. This will revisit existing doctrinal interpretative debates concerning the obligation under Article VI, particularly the requirements that negotiations and measures be adopted in good faith, and what constitutes an effective measure towards nuclear disarmament. The discussion will then determine whether the CEND initiative itself can be considered a good faith, effective measure towards nuclear disarmament, by considering its purpose, origins and implementation, and actions of the US.

J	Alim, E				Alim, Eray			An Analysis of the Potential Consequences of Denuclearization with Reference to Ukraine	GAZI AKADEMIK BAKIS-GAZI ACADEMIC VIEW			Turkish	Article						Ukraine; Russia; Ukraine Crisis; Nuclear Weapons; Nuclear Deterrence	NUCLEAR; DETERRENCE; POWER; BOMB	Nuclear weapons reduce the likelihood of war and conflict among nuclear-armed states. States that are in an inferior position in the military balance gain "absolute deterrence", if they possess nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are, therefore, functional devices in calibrating deterrence asymmetry between weak and strong states in favor of the former. In this article's case study, Russia-Ukraine relations, should be understood in this light. As witnessed during the 2014 Ukraine crisis, Russia violated Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity through military incursions into Crimea and Donbas. In the light of Russia's military actions, discussions surrounding Ukraine's elimination of its nuclear arsenal, which took place during the 1990's, have surfaced again. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited the world's third largest nuclear weapons stockpile, which it removed from its soil during a process that was completed in 1996. This work seeks to trace this process and analyze the potential impacts of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament with reference to the 2014 crisis. By way of conclusion, in the context of the 2014 crisis that, denuclearization constitutes a potential national security risk for states (Ukraine) that face formidable nuclear-armed rivals (Russia).

J	Dvorkin, VZ				Dvorkin, Vladimir Z.			NUCLEAR DETERRENCE: CONCEPTS AND RISKS	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						types of massive nuclear strikes; launch-on-warning strike; early warning systems; decision-making time		Among the existing forms of exchange of massive nuclear strikes between strategic nuclear forces of Russia and the United States (first disarming, launch-on-warning, and retaliation strikes), launch-on-warning is the one that poses the biggest risk. The decision to carry out this type of strike can be made within a few minutes based on data from an early warning system. Since there is no way to completely rule out the possibility of errors in generation of that data, the main focus in the concept of nuclear deterrence should be made on the retaliation strike. This strike posture has always been used as a rationale for the composition of Strategic Rocket Force and Navy forces which focus on ensuring that weapons can survive a disarmament first strike from a potential adversary. This would allow more time for decision-making regarding the use of nuclear forces; therefore, due to the increased vulnerability of informational systems, the principles of a retaliation strike should be given more attention in planning operations involving strategic nuclear forces. Early warning systems should be used first and foremost for the global monitoring of missile and carrier rocket launches, i.e. monitoring accidental (unintended) and provocative missile launches, as well as for assessing nations' compliance with the Missile Technology Control Regime.

J	Arbatov, AG				Arbatov, Aleksei G.			DREAMS AND REALITIES OF ARMS CONTROL	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						Arms control; nuclear weapons; limited nuclear war concepts; nuclear escalation; strategic conventional arms; dual purpose systems; hypersonic weapons; space arms; cyber warfare; remote control systems		Against the background of the comprehensive crisis of the nuclear arms control treaties three new principle schools of strategic thinking have emerged and are affecting the governments of the great powers. One of them is "neo-hawks", who are claiming that disarmament agreements are detrimental by hindering the development of new nuclear arms, which have once again become an effective tool of policy and war after deep reductions during the last thirty years. These experts advocate new programs of nuclear, conventional, and dual purpose weapon systems and elaborate strategic concepts of limited nuclear warfare, controlled escalation, and victory in a nuclear war. Another school - "idealists" who call for ending with nuclear weapons by a single grand treaty of the kind they managed to promote in the UN in 2017 - the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The third school is "revisionists" who argue that nuclear multipolarity, proliferation and new military technologies (hypersonic missiles, cyber warfare, long-range armed drones, space weapons, etc.) have made traditional arms control outdated. They propose to revise the notions of parity and strategic stability, the practice of nuclear arms reductions and limitations, numerical ceilings and meticulous verification procedures. As a replacement they promote the idea of various multilateral dialogues with the goal of enhancing mutual nuclear deterrence, predictability, and trust among nations. A closer scrutiny demonstrates extreme danger of the first type of thinking which is leading to a nuclear war. The second school's idea, for all good intentions of its authors, is impossible to implement. It mistakenly treats nuclear disarmament as a technical issue, while it is an extremely complex political and strategic problem. The third group may do still more harm by persuading state leaders and public opinion that the collapse of the arms control is not dangerous: allegedly it is possible to enhance security without long and exhausting negotiations and complex agreements. In contrast to the above ideas, provided political will of the leaderships of the major nations, it is still possible to save or revive some important treaties and move forward addressing many novel weapons and technologies by aims control talks. Dynamic changes of the world order, military hard- and software, and strategic thinking - all these are making arms control more vital for the Russian and international security than ever before.

J	Dvorkin, VZ				Dvorkin, Vladimir Z.			IMPACT OF MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS ON STRATEGIC STABILITY AND PROSPECTS FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						ballistic missile defense systems; ballistic missiles intercept systems; strategic and regional stability; effectiveness of ballistic missile defenses; START negotiations		For many decades, in terms of strategic stability, ballistic missile defense systems developed and deployed by the Soviet Union/Russia and the United States have been seen as potentially destabilizing. However, although significant technological progress has been achieved in creating ballistic missile interception systems and global information network, over 60 years of experience in the development and flight testing have confirmed the impossibility of protecting the countries' territory from massive nuclear strikes. It is possible to intercept only a single missile or an extremely small number of them. An objective analysis of the state and effectiveness of existing and potential future characteristics of missile defense systems suggests that their impact on the nuclear deterrence capability of Russia and the United States is virtually absent and does not hinder the negotiation processes aimed at limiting strategic of fensive arms. That being said, missile defense systems have a potential to significantly affect regional stability and, depending on the situation, have both stabilizing and destabilizing effect on the military and political landscape. It is therefore incumbent upon the UN Security Council and other international organizations to continuously monitor regional stability in order to be able to react promptly and prevent negative development of the situation.

J	Arbatov, AG				Arbatov, Aleksei G.			FACING RACE WITH NO RULES? (Nuclear deterrence without arms control)	MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA			Russian	Article						nuclear arms; strategic weapons; intercontinental ballistic missiles; medium-and short-range missiles; nuclear arms control treaties; anti-ballistic missile defense; hypersonic weapons; nuclear use threshold; concepts of limited nuclear war		By the end of the second decade of the 21st century, due to domestic and international developments, Russia and the West entered a state of tensions and a new cycle of the arms race - unprecedented since the worst times of the Cold War. Both sides got into this phase of relationship under the new world order, with advanced military technologies and under the rule of a new generation of political leaders. The turning point of these dangerous trends came with the decision of the United States to withdraw from the INF Treaty and high probability of the expiration of the New START without its extension or substitution by a follow-on treaty after 2021. Hence, the U.S. and Russia are on the verge of a new large-scale and uncontrolled nuclear arms race, which will be aggravated by the rivalry in offensive and defensive conventional strategic and medium range systems, as well as space weapons and means of cyber warfare. In combination with the development and deployment of short-flight-time ballistic and hypersonic systems as well as introduction of low-yield strategic and tactical nuclear arms for "limited" and "tailored" nuclear attacks this would drastically lower nuclear use threshold and increase incentives for preventive or preemptive nuclear strikes. In addition, the arms race will be multilateral, involving, beside the U.S. and Russia, China and many other nations. This would undercut the norms and regimes of nuclear non-proliferation, security and safety of nuclear materials, technologies and sites, which sooner or later would provide international terrorism with the access to nuclear weapons - with all the ensuing consequences. This article is dedicated to the above dangers and still remaining possibilities of averting them. In particular, if the two sides agreed on the new intrusive verification procedures, the INF Treaty still could be saved. Likewise, extension of the New START might stabilize strategic relations for another five years after its expiration in 2021. During those years or, still better, during two years remaining till 2021, a follow-on treaty could be negotiated to reduce strategic arms ceilings and envelop advanced destabilizing nuclear and conventional weapons.

J	McCrisken, T; Downman, M				McCrisken, Trevor; Downman, Maxwell			"Peace through strength': Europe and NATO deterrence beyond the US Nuclear Posture Review	INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						US foreign policy; nuclear; European security; transatlantic relations; Russia; international security	TRUMP	With its 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, the Trump administration expanded the scope of US nuclear deterrence, re-emphasizing the importance of non-strategic nuclear weapons, perceptively lowering the threshold for nuclear use and casting doubt on the future of arms control. The authors argue that these changes are consistent with the administration's wider peace through strength' approach that draws on traditional Republican thinking on security policy. While designed to demonstrate credibility and resolve to both allies and adversaries, however, this assertive approach to security policy and specifically nuclear policy as a necessary precursor to renewed engagement in strategic negotiations may have unintended consequences. This article focuses on European reactions to the strategy and argues that the Trump administration's nuclear posture challenges common European understandings in three principal areas. First, changes to US declaratory policy contest European assumptions on the role of nuclear weapons in defending NATO. Second, US modernization plans and their implications for intra-alliance relations risk accentuating controversial debates about the US commitment to Europe. Third, the apparent US rejection of arms control widens the scope for discord with European leaders. If European leaders assert a clear and credible alternative vision advocating nuclear restraint, risk reduction and arms control they could rebuild trust and confidence between the United States, NATO and Russia, demonstrating real strength and ultimately leading to more genuine opportunities for peace and sustainable European security.

J	Pynnoniemi, K				Pynnoniemi, Katri			The Asymmetric Approach in Russian Security Strategy: Implications for the Nordic Countries	TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE			English	Article						Russian information influence; Cold War; Active Measures; Soviet propaganda; reflexive control; Sweden; Finland		Two observations stand out from the Russian strategic outlook. First, it corresponds with the real politik vision of world politics where the states engage in (zero-sum) competition for power and resources. Second, the new world order emerges because of a conflict between different models of development and value systems. These two observations highlight a certain "family resemblance" between the current Russian assessment of the current security environment and the situation during the Cold War. Furthermore, Russian national security strategy is oriented toward achieving strategic stability with the other great powers. The maintenance of strategic parity (nuclear and conventional deterrence) is a means to this end. However, given Russia's relative weakness in comparison to its major geopolitical competitors, this has led to the renewal of the Cold War-era concept of asymmetric approach. Although this concept is most often used in the context of nuclear deterrence and the debate on "strategic stability," it is not about military security only. The set of asymmetric measures from economic dependence or sanctions, to diplomatic, political, and informational measures are used to prevent an emergence of a conflict that would threaten Russia's sovereignty and domestic stability. The purpose of this paper is to explore the Soviet roots of Active Measures and how the Soviet heritage is present at both the theoretical level and in concrete practices. Finally, insights from the conceptual analysis are applied in assessing the vulnerability of the Nordic countries, in particular Finland and Sweden, to Russian influence operations.

J	Kuhn, U				Kuhn, Ulrich			The End of Conventional Arms Control and the Role of US Congress	JOURNAL FOR PEACE AND NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT			English	Article						Conventional arms control in Europe; CFE Treaty; Russia; United States; US Congress; NATO		The renewed conflict between Russia and NATO has brought back security concerns over nuclear and conventional deterrence and defence in Europe. Since the days of the Cold War those two elements are closely intertwined, with direct ramifications on arms control policies. This article recalls the post-Cold War history of conventional arms control in Europe. It focuses on the underexplored impact of the US legislative during the mid-to-late-1990s. Relying on open sources from US Congress, the article traces the political standstill on conventional arms control to a crucial Congressional decision in the year 1997 which ultimately tied the future of this arms control regime to the solution of two protracted conflicts in the post-Soviet space. The article challenges the mainstream view that Russia is solely to blame for the dissolution of conventional arms control and concludes that without solving the standstill, nuclear arms control for Europe will as well remain deadlocked.
